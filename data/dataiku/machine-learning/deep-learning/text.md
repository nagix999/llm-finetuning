Using text features[¶](#using-text-features "Permalink to this heading")
========================================================================


DSS provides several builtin ways to handle text features, such as Counts vectorization (See [Text variables](../features-handling/text.html) for more details).


However, for Deep Learning algorithms, you may want to use a Custom preprocessing to build 2\-D or 3\-D vectors . In that case, you need to write your own processor (See [Custom Preprocessing](../features-handling/custom.html)). You can use the TokenizerProcessor provided by DSS:



```
from dataiku.doctor.deep_learning.preprocessing import TokenizerProcessor

# Defines a processor that tokenizes a text. It computes a vocabulary on all the corpus.
# Then, each text is converted to a vector representing the sequence of words, where each
# element represents the index of the corresponding word in the vocabulary. The result is
# padded with 0 up to the `max_len` in order for all the vectors to have the same length.

#   num_words  - maximum number of words in the vocabulary
#   max_len    - length of each sequence. If the text is longer,
#                it will be truncated, and if it is shorter, it will be padded
#                with 0.
processor = TokenizerProcessor(num_words=10000, max_len=32)

```


With this example, the output for each text will have a (32\) shape. Then, this output is sent to a textFeature\_preprocessed input, so the corresponding input in the model should look like:



```
input_text = Input(shape=(32), name="textFeature_preprocessed")

```


See [Deep learning for sentiment (text) analysis](https://knowledge.dataiku.com/latest/ml-analytics/nlp/deep-learning-sentiment-analysis/tutorial-index.html) for a step\-by\-step example of this in practice.
