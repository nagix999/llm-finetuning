Models lifecycle[Â¶](#models-lifecycle "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================


Using machine learning in DSS is a process in two steps:


* The models are designed, trained, explored and selected in the **Lab**
* Once you are satisfied with your model, you **Deploy** it from the lab to the Flow, where it appears as a **Saved model**


A Saved model is deployed together with a **Training recipe** that allows you to retrain the saved models, with the same model settings, but possibly with new training data.


A Saved Model on the Flow can be used:


* For real\-time APIs, using the [API node](../apinode/index.html)
* By a **Scoring recipe**, in order to perform prediction (or clustering) on a non\-labelled dataset
