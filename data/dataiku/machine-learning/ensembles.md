Models ensembling[¶](#models-ensembling "Permalink to this heading")
====================================================================


You can ensemble prediction models in DSS using various ensembling methods.


In the analysis results page, select several models, and click Actions \> Create ensemble model.



Limitations[¶](#limitations "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


* Only models trained with the same preprocessing settings can be ensembled.
* It is not possible to ensemble models with different time ordering or weight parameters.
* It is not possible to ensemble models trained using K\-Fold cross\-test.
* It is not possible to ensemble models trained with vector or image features.
* It is not possible to ensemble partitioned models.
* It is not possible to ensemble computer vision models.
* After deployment as a saved model, it is not possible to retrain an ensemble model on the automation node.
* After deployment as a saved model, it is not possible to retrain an ensemble model if the original models have been removed from the analysis screen.
