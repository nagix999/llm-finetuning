Writing custom models[Â¶](#writing-custom-models "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================


DSS does not restrict you to the algorithms that are part of its visual ML capabilities, but allows you to code your own model, either in Python or in Scala.


* For more information on creating custom models, see [Custom Models](algorithms/in-memory-python.html#custom-models).
* To make a plugin out of a custom model, see [Component: Prediction algorithm](../plugins/reference/prediction-algorithms.html).
* To create a custom model to train with the MLlib backend, see [MLLib (Spark) engine](algorithms/mllib.html).
* To create a custom model using MLflow Model, see [MLflow Models](../mlops/mlflow-models/index.html).
