Evaluation Metrics[¶](#evaluation-metrics "Permalink to this heading")
======================================================================


For Object detection, the model will maximize the F1 score by default, which is a weighted average of the precision and recall. Depending on your use case, you may want to optimize for either recall or precision:



> * Maximizing the recall will train the model to predict marginally likely objects, which is useful in cases where your classes of interest are under\-represented in your training data.
> * Maximizing the precision will predict only the most likely objects, which is useful in cases where your classes of interest are well\-represented in your training data.


For Image classification the model will maximize the ROC AUC score by default but other multiclass metrics are available: Precision, Recall, F1 score, Accuracy, Log Loss and Average Precision.
