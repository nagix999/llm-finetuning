Requirements[Â¶](#requirements "Permalink to this heading")
==========================================================



Note


We recommend using Dataiku Cloud Stacks, which fulfills all Code Studios requirements out of the box.



In order to use Code Studios:


* [Elastic AI computation](../containers/index.html) must be fully setup (which includes having a containerized execution config, having the ability to build images and push them to the registry, and having a cluster defined)
* Your `kubectl` version should be at least 1\.23\.
