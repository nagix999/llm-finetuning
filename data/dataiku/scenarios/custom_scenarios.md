Custom scenarios[¶](#custom-scenarios "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================


Instead of being simply step\-based, custom scenarios are a full\-fledged Python program which may execute everything that DSS scenarios can, while providing the user with full configurability and advanced logic capabilities.



What can a custom scenario do[¶](#what-can-a-custom-scenario-do "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A custom scenario can:


* Execute all steps that can be defined in a “step\-based scenario”. For more information, see [Scenario steps](steps.html).
* Read metadata about the executed steps, like:



> + Failure / Success
> 	+ Count and types of warnings
> 	+ Detailed list of built datasets, trained models, …
* Read details about trained models (performance metrics, …)
* Read detailed parameters of the trigger that initiated this scenario.
* Activate new versions of trained models
* Read metrics and checks status for datasets
* Read the build state: when was a dataset last built, a model last trained, …
* Send custom messages through the reporters at any point of the scenario (not only at the beginning or end)


In addition, a custom scenario can use the whole internal and public Python API.


The details of the scenarios API can be found in [Scenarios](https://developer.dataiku.com/latest/api-reference/python/scenarios.html "(in Developer Guide)").



Note


The scenario API cannot be used in a Python recipe/Jupyter notebook.





Examples[¶](#examples "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------



### Basic usage[¶](#basic-usage "Permalink to this heading")


This custom scenario builds datasets and trains models. Note that a step\-based scenario suffices for this usage.



```
from dataiku.scenario import Scenario

# Create the main handle to interact with the scenario
scenario = Scenario()

# Build a dataset
scenario.build_dataset("mydatasetname")

# Build a partitioned data (this uses the partitions spec syntax)
scenario.build_dataset("mydatasetname", partitions="partition1,partition2")

# Train a model. The model id can be found in the URL of the model settings page
scenario.train_model("epae130z")

```




### Send custom reports[¶](#send-custom-reports "Permalink to this heading")


Reports can be sent at any time of the scenario. You’ll need to have a preconfigured messaging channel.



```
from dataiku.scenario import Scenario
scenario = Scenario()

message_sender = scenario.get_message_sender("channel-name")

# You can then call send() with message params.
# params are specific to each message channel types

# SMTP mail example
message_sender.send(sender="", recipient="", subject="", message="")

# You can also call set_params to set params on the sender that will be reused for all subsequent 'send' calls
message_sender.set_params(sender="[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)", recipent="[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)")
message_sender.send(subject="All is well", message="Scenario is working as expected")

# Twilio SMS alert example
message_sender.send(fromNumber="", toNumber="", message="")

```


You can also send message to Microsoft Teams. Here is an example where `my-teams-channel` is a preconfigured messaging channel:



```
from dataiku.scenario import Scenario
scenario = Scenario()

message_sender = scenario.get_message_sender("my-teams-channel")
message_sender.send(message="Scenario is working as expected")

```


Here is another example that uses an ad\-hoc channel:



```
from dataiku.scenario import Scenario
scenario = Scenario()

message_sender = scenario.get_message_sender(None, "msft-teams-scenario")
message_sender.send(message="Scenario is working as expected", webhookUrl="Webhook URL of the Teams channel")

```


If you want to send an email message in HTML format, you can pass the parameter `sendAsHTML=True` in your send function. Here is an example where `my-email-channel` is a preconfigured messaging channel:



```
from dataiku.scenario import Scenario
scenario = Scenario()

message_sender = scenario.get_message_sender("my-email-channel")
# some HTML-formatted text
html_message = "<p style='color:orange'>Your scenario is running!</p><p>While waiting, check out this <a href='https://www.dataiku.com'>awesome website</a></p>"
message_sender.send(subject="The scenario is doing well", message=html_message, sendAsHTML=True)

```
