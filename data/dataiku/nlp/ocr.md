OCR (Optical Character recognition)[¶](#ocr-optical-character-recognition "Permalink to this heading")
======================================================================================================


OCR is the process of recognizing, parsing and extracting text from images.


Dataiku leverages two open source OCR engines:


* The [Tesseract library](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/) to perform OCR in [100 languages](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files/)
* The EasyOCR library


It is an offline capability, meaning that it does not leverage a 3rd party API.



Note


This capability is provided by the “Text extraction and OCR” plugin, which you need to install. Please see [Installing plugins](../plugins/installing.html).


This plugin is [Not supported](../troubleshooting/support-tiers.html)
