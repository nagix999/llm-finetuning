Setting up[¶](#setting-up "Permalink to this heading")
======================================================



Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------



Warning


API Deployer is not responsible for starting and managing your Kubernetes cluster, which must already exist.



The prerequisites for deploying API services on Kubernetes are:


* You need to have an existing Kubernetes cluster. The “kubectl” command on the API Deployer node must be fully functional and usable by the user running DSS.
* The local “docker” command must be usable by the user running DSS. That includes the permission to build images, and thus access to a Docker socket
* You need to have an image registry, accessible by your Kubernetes cluster
* The local “docker” command must have permission to push images to your image registry




Limitations[¶](#limitations "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


* The MacOS installation of DSS does not support Kubernetes
* API services using conda\-based code environments are not supported
* Your DSS machine must have direct outgoing Internet access in order to install packages
* Your containers must have direct outgoing Internet access in order to install packages




Build the base image[¶](#build-the-base-image "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Before you can deploy to Kubernetes, a “base image” must be constructed. Each API Deployer deployment will then create a final Docker image made of:


* The base image
* An additional layer containing the API Service data and settings


Each Deployment infrastructure on the API Deployer can use a different base image. If you don’t configure anything specific, all infrastructures will use a default base image.



Warning


After each upgrade of DSS, you must rebuild all base images



From the DSS Datadir, run



```
./bin/dssadmin build-base-image --type api-deployer

```


For more details on building base images and customizing base images, please see [Initial setup](../../containers/setup-k8s.html) and [Customization of base images](../../containers/custom-base-images.html).




Create the Kubernetes infrastructure in DSS[¶](#create-the-kubernetes-infrastructure-in-dss "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Go to API Deployer \> Infrastructures
* Create a new infra with type Kubernetes
* Go to Settings \> Kubernetes cluster


The elements you may need to customize are:


* Kubectl context: if your kubectl configuration file has several contexts, you need to indicate which one DSS will target \- this allows you to target multiple Kubernetes cluster from a single API Deployer by using several kubectl contexts
* Kubernetes namespace: all elements created by DSS in your Kubernetes cluster will be created in that namespace
* Registry host
