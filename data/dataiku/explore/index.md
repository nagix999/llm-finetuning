Exploring your data[¶](#exploring-your-data "Permalink to this heading")
========================================================================


Once you have defined a dataset, the first thing that DSS allows you to do is to view your data in the “Explore” component.


Explore shows you [a sample](sampling.html) of your dataset. It also provides:


* Quick descriptive statistics, either on the sample on the entirety of the data
* Meanings, i.e. rich types. See [Schemas, storage types and meanings](../schemas/index.html) for more information
* An overview of all columns
* The ability to sort and filter the sample
* The ability to choose which columns are displayed


All these abilities are also available while [doing visual preparation](../preparation/index.html) of your data.



Note


For an introduction to the exploration component of Data Science Studio, we recommend that you first consult the [Knowledge Base](https://knowledge.dataiku.com/latest/data-sourcing/datasets/index.html).
