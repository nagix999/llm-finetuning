Geo join[Â¶](#geo-join "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================


The Geo join visual recipe allows you to perform a join between two (or more) datasets based on geospatial matching conditions.


This visual recipe offers multiple geospatial matching conditions. Join clauses can be chained together to perform join operations on many input datasets. Matching conditions can be combined to perform complex operations. Like other join recipes in DSS, join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL or CROSS) are defined for each individual join clause.
