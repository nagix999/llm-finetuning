Hadoop user isolation[¶](#hadoop-user-isolation "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================


The regular behavior of DSS is to run as a single UNIX account on its host machine (let’s call it `dssuser`). When a DSS end\-user executes an Hadoop recipe or notebook, it runs on the cluster as the `dssuser` Hadoop user.


DSS supports an alternate mode of deployment, called *user isolation*. In this mode, DSS will *impersonate* the end\-user and run all user\-controlled code under a different identity than the `dssuser` user.
