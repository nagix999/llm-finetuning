[Version 5\.0\.0 \- July 25th, 2018](#id92)[¶](#version-5-0-0-july-25th-2018 "Permalink to this heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DSS 5\.0\.0 is a very major upgrade to DSS with major new features. For a summary of the major new features, see: <https://www.dataiku.com/learn/whatsnew>



### [New features](#id93)[¶](#new-features "Permalink to this heading")



#### [Deep learning](#id94)[¶](#deep-learning "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now fully integrates deep learning capabilities to build powerful deep\-learning models within the DSS visual machine learning component.


Deep learning in DSS is “semi\-visual”:


* You write the code that defines the architecture of your deep learning model
* DSS handles all the rest (preprocessing data, feeding model, training, showing charts, integrating Tensorboard, …)


DSS Deep Learning is based on the Keras \+ TensorFlow couple. You will mostly write Keras code to define your deep learning models.


DSS Deep Learning supports training on CPU and GPU, including multiple GPUs. Through container deployment capabilities, you can train and deploy models on cloud\-enabled dynamic GPUs clusters.


Please see [Deep Learning](../machine-learning/deep-learning/index.html) for more information




#### [Containerized execution on Docker and Kubernetes](#id95)[¶](#containerized-execution-on-docker-and-kubernetes "Permalink to this heading")


You can now run parts of the processing tasks of the DSS design and automation nodes on one or several hosts, powered by Docker or Kubernetes:


* Python and R recipes
* Plugin recipes
* In\-memory machine\-learning


This is fully compatible with cloud managed serverless Kubernetes stacks


Please see [Elastic AI computation](../containers/index.html) for more information.




#### [Wiki](#id96)[¶](#wiki "Permalink to this heading")


Each DSS project now contains a Wiki. You can use the Wiki for documentation, organization, sharing, … purposes.


The DSS wiki is based on the well\-known [Markdown](../collaboration/markdown.html) language.


In addition to writing Wiki pages, the DSS wiki features powerful capabilities like attachments and hierarchical taxonomy.


Please see [Wikis](../collaboration/wiki.html) for more information.




#### [Discussions](#id97)[¶](#id24 "Permalink to this heading")


You can now have full discussions on any DSS object (dataset, recipe, …). Discussions feature rich editing capabilities, notifications, integrations, …


Discussions replace the old “comments” feature.


Please see [Discussions](../collaboration/discussions.html) for more information.




#### [New homepage and navigation](#id98)[¶](#new-homepage-and-navigation "Permalink to this heading")


The homepage of DSS has been revamped in order to show to each user the most relevant items.


The homepage will show recently used and favorite items first. It shows projects, dashboards and wikis, but also individual items (recipes, datasets, …) for quick deep links.


In addition, the global navigation of DSS has been overhauled, with menus, and better organization.




#### [Grouping projects into folders](#id99)[¶](#grouping-projects-into-folders "Permalink to this heading")


You can now organize projects on the projects list into hierarchical folders.




#### [Dashboards exports](#id100)[¶](#dashboards-exports "Permalink to this heading")


Dashboards can now be exported to PDF or image files in order to propagate information inside your organization more easily.


Dashboard exports can be:


* Created and downloaded manually from the dashboard interface
* Created automatically and sent by mail using the “mail reporters” mechanism in a scenario
* Created automatically and stored in a managed folder using a dedicated scenario step


See [Exporting dashboards to PDF or images](../dashboards/exports.html) for more information




#### [Resource control](#id101)[¶](#resource-control "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now features full integration with the Linux cgroups functionality in order to restrict resource usages per project, user, category, … and protect DSS against memory overruns.


See [Using cgroups for resource control](../operations/cgroups.html) for more information





### [Other notable enhancements](#id102)[¶](#other-notable-enhancements "Permalink to this heading")



#### [Support for culling of idle Jupyter notebooks](#id103)[¶](#support-for-culling-of-idle-jupyter-notebooks "Permalink to this heading")


Administrators can use the Macro “Kill Jupyter sessions” to automatically stop Jupyter notebooks that have been running or been idle for too long, in order to conserve resources.




#### [Support for XGBoost on GPU](#id104)[¶](#support-for-xgboost-on-gpu "Permalink to this heading")
