------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DSS 11\.0\.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with major new features.



### [Major new features](#id349)[¶](#major-new-features "Permalink to this heading")



#### [Visual Time Series Forecasting](#id350)[¶](#id108 "Permalink to this heading")


Time Series Forecasting is now natively available in DSS Visual ML. Visual Time Series Forecasting features many capabilities:


* Single or multiple series
* Multiple horizon forecasting
* Multiple algorithms, including deep learning algorithms


Time Series Forecasting are fully deployable and governable like other DSS Visual Models.


For more details, please see [Time Series Forecasting](../machine-learning/time-series-forecasting/index.html)




#### [Code Studios, including Visual Studio Code, JupyterLab and RStudio](#id351)[¶](#code-studios-including-visual-studio-code-jupyterlab-and-rstudio "Permalink to this heading")


Code Studios allow DSS users to harness the power and versatility of many Web\-based IDEs and web application building frameworks.


Code Studios allow you, for example, to:


* Edit and debug Python, R, SQL, … recipes and libraries in Visual Studio Code
* Edit and debug Python or R recipes, notebooks, libraries, … in JupyterLab
* Edit and debug R recipes and libraries in RStudio Server


For more details, please see [Code Studios](../code-studios/index.html)




#### [Image Labeling](#id352)[¶](#id109 "Permalink to this heading")


In order to create and fine\-tune image models (classification and object detection), you first need labeled images. Labeling is often a tedious task.


DSS now features a native Image Labeling capability, with the following features:


* Support for image classification and object detection use cases
* Ability to invite annotators (people who label the images)
* Efficient interface for annotators with keyboard shortcuts
* Ability to request annotations from multiple annotatorss
* Annotations review process with management of conflicts between annotators


This new capability allows you to perform even more of the entire Machine Learning cycle for computer vision in DSS.




#### [MLOps: Experiment Tracking](#id353)[¶](#mlops-experiment-tracking "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now includes an experiment tracker for logging parameters, performance metrics, models, and other metadata when running your machine learning code, and for visualizing results of such experiments.


The DSS Experiment Tracker leverages the well\-known MLflow Tracking API, which allows you to seamlessly port existing or 3rd party experiment tracking code and get all DSS benefits.


For more details, please see [Experiment Tracking](../mlops/experiment-tracking/index.html)




#### [MLOps: Feature Store](#id354)[¶](#mlops-feature-store "Permalink to this heading")


A Feature Store helps Data Scientists, build, find and use relevant data for models in order to build efficient models faster.


Most key components of a Feature Store are native capabilities of DSS:


* Feature Storage is handled by Dataiku extensive [Connections Library](../connecting/connections.html)
* Data Ingestion and Curation is performed using [Recipes in the Flow](../flow/index.html)
* Offline serving for batch processing is done using [Join Recipes](../other_recipes/join.html) in [projects deployed on an Automation node](../deployment/index.html)
* Online serving for realtime processing is done using [Dataset Lookups](../apinode/endpoint-dataset-lookup.html) in API services
* Data monitoring is implemented using [Metrics \& Checks](../scenarios/index.html)
* Automated building and maintenance is managed by [Scenarios and Triggers](../scenarios/index.html)


DSS 11 adds a new *Feature Store* section, which acts as the central registry of all *Feature Groups*, a *Feature Group* being a curated and promoted Dataset containing valuable *Features*.


For more details, please see [Feature Store](../mlops/feature-store/index.html)




#### [Data Visualization: New Pivot Table](#id355)[¶](#data-visualization-new-pivot-table "Permalink to this heading")


The Pivot Table has been strongly overhauled. It now supports:


* Multiple dimensions on rows and columns, with subtotal support
* Excel Export of multiple dimensions and multiple measures


For more details, please see [Charts](../visualization/index.html)




#### [Quick Sharing](#id356)[¶](#quick-sharing "Permalink to this heading")


Project administrators can now enable “Quick Sharing”, which allows any user who has read access to the project to share a dataset to his own project, without having to ask the project administrator first.


Quick Sharing can be globally disabled by instance administrators.


For more details, please see [Shared objects](../security/shared-objects.html)




#### [Access \& Sharing requests](#id357)[¶](#access-sharing-requests "Permalink to this heading")


Project administrators can now choose to make their project “discoverable”, which allows users who don’t have access to the project to still discover its existence and basic information about it (name, description, …), and then to request access to it.


Project administrators receive notifications about access requests, and can manage them, grant them or reject them.


Similarly, users who have access to a project can now request that datasets be shared with their own projects, and project administrators can manage these sharing requests (if they don’t have Quick Sharing enabled).


These mechanisms can be globally disabled by instance administrators.


For more details, please see [Requests](../collaboration/requests.html)




#### [Create if, then, else processor](#id358)[¶](#create-if-then-else-processor "Permalink to this heading")


This new visual data preparation processor performs actions or calculations based on conditional statements defined using an “if, then else” syntax.


It can be used notably to create new columns based on conditions on the values of other columns. While this was previously feasible using formulas or the [Switch case](../preparation/processors/switch-case.html) processor, the new [Create if, then, else statements](../preparation/processors/create-if-then-else.html) processor can provide much more flexibility, without having to write complex formulas.


For more details, please see [Create if, then, else statements](../preparation/processors/create-if-then-else.html)




#### [Flow Document Generator](#id359)[¶](#flow-document-generator "Permalink to this heading")


In regulated industries, it is often required to document flows, at creation and after every change for traceability. This is often tedious. DSS now features the ability to automatically generate a DOCX document from a Flow, which documents the whole flow, including datasets and recipes details.


For more details, please see [Flow Document Generator](../flow/flow-document-generator.html).




#### [Govern: Projects and bundles governance](#id360)[¶](#govern-projects-and-bundles-governance "Permalink to this heading")


The [Govern Node](../governance/index.html) now supports managing, governing, and controlling deployment of Project Bundles in the Deployer

### [Other notable enhancements and features](#id362)[¶](#other-notable-enhancements-and-features "Permalink to this heading")



#### [Outcome Optimization for regression](#id363)[¶](#outcome-optimization-for-regression "Permalink to this heading")


The “What\-If” feature now supports Outcome Optimization for regression problems. Outcome Optimization allows you to start from a given record, and to explore the neighborhood of this record to find the changes to input features that would lead to changes in the predicted value, towards either the largest, smallest, or a specific value. You can select which features can be modified and which can’t.




#### [Nested filters](#id364)[¶](#nested-filters "Permalink to this heading")


In locations where visual filters can be used, it is now possible to nest complex boolean conditions, such as:


* If col1 is 2
* AND
	+ col2 is 3
	+ OR col3 is 4


This applies to:


* The Filter visual recipe
* The “Create\-if\-then\-else” prepare processor
* The “Pre/Post filters” of all visual recipes
* Filters in Explore and Charts sampling
* Filters in Visual ML
