### [Important notes about migration](#id47)[¶](#id12 "Permalink to this heading")


The automatic data migration procedure is documented in [Upgrading a DSS instance](../installation/custom/upgrade.html)


As usual, we **strongly recommend** that you perform a full backup of your Data Science Studio data directory prior to starting the upgrade procedure.


Automatic migration of data from Data Science Studio 1\.3\.X is supported, with the following restrictions and warnings:


* The “dip.flow.activities.nthreads” parameter in dip.properties has been removed. Setting the number of activities is now done in the Administration pages (Settings \> Build).
* Referencing a dip.properties entry from a FS dataset path is not possible anymore. Use the variables expansion system.


For migrations from Data Science Studio 1\.2\.X, please also see the release notes of version 1\.3\.0




### [New features](#id48)[¶](#id13 "Permalink to this heading")



#### Mac OS X[¶](#mac-os-x "Permalink to this heading")
