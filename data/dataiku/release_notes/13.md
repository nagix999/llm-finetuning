### [Limitations and warnings](#id34)[¶](#limitations-and-warnings "Permalink to this heading")


Automatic migration from previous versions is supported (see above). Please pay attention to the following cautions, removal and deprecation notices.




### [Cautions](#id35)[¶](#cautions "Permalink to this heading")



#### [XGBoost models migration](#id36)[¶](#xgboost-models-migration "Permalink to this heading")


DSS 13\.0 now uses XGBoost 1\.5 in the default VisualML setup.


Existing models can still be used for scoring without retraining if [Optimized scoring](../machine-learning/scoring-engines.html) is used. Note that in particular, row\-level explanations cannot use Optimized scoring.


If Optimized scoring cannot be used, you will need to either:


* Retrain XGBoost models
* Or run the [XGBoost models upgrade macros](../machine-learning/algorithms/in-memory-python.html#xgboost-upgrade-macros).




#### [Python 2\.7 builtin env removal](#id37)[¶](#python-2-7-builtin-env-removal "Permalink to this heading")



Note


If you are using Dataiku Cloud or Dataiku Cloud Stacks, you do not need to pay attention to this


Very few Dataiku Custom customers are affected by this, as this was a very legacy setup.



Python 2\.7 support for the builtin env of Dataiku was deprecated years ago and is now fully removed. If your builtin env was still Python 2\.7, it will automatically migrate to Python 3\. This may affect:


* Existing code running on the builtin env, that may need adaptations to work in Python 3\.
* Machine Learning models, that will usually need to be retrained





### [Support removal](#id38)[¶](#support-removal "Permalink to this heading")


Some features that were previously announced as deprecated are now removed or unsupported


* Hadoop distributions support


	+ Support for Cloudera CDH 6
	+ Support for Cloudera HDP 3
	+ Support for Amazon EMR
* OS support


	+ Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux before 7\.9
	+ Support for CentOS 7 before 7\.9
	+ Support for Oracle Linux before 7\.9
	+ Support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15, 15 SP1, 15 SP2
	+ Support fot CentOS 8
* Support for Java 8
* Support for Python 2\.7




### [Deprecation notices](#id39)[¶](#deprecation-notices "Permalink to this heading")


DSS 13 deprecates support for some features and versions. Support for these will be removed in a later release.


* Support for Ubuntu 18\.04
* Support for RedHat 7
* Support for CentOS 7
* Support for Oracle Linux 7
* Support for SuSE Linux 12
* Support for SuSE Linux 15 SP3
* Support for Scala notebook for Spark
* Support for multiple Hadoop clusters





[Version 13\.1\.0 \- August 14th, 2024](#id40)[¶](#version-13-1-0-august-14th-2024 "Permalink to this heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DSS 13\.1\.0 is a significant new release with both new features, performance enhancements and bugfixes.



### [New feature: Managed LLM fine\-tuning](#id41)[¶](#new-feature-managed-llm-fine-tuning "Permalink to this heading")



Note


This feature is available in Private Preview as part of the Advanced LLM Mesh Early Adopter Program



LLM Fine\-tuning allows you to fine\-tune LLMs using your data.


Fine\-tuning is available:


* Using a visual recipe for local models (HuggingFace) and OpenAI models
* Using Python recipes for local models (HuggingFace)


For more information, please see [Model fine\-tuning](../generative-ai/model-fine-tuning.html)




### [New feature: Gauge chart](#id42)[¶](#new-feature-gauge-chart "Permalink to this heading")


The Gauge chart, also known as speedometer, is used to display data along a circular axis to demonstrate performance or progress. This axis can be colored to offer better segmentation and clarity.


![../_images/gauge.png](../_images/gauge.png)


### [New feature: Chart median and percentile aggregations](#id43)[¶](#new-feature-chart-median-and-percentile-aggregations "Permalink to this heading")


Charts (and pivot tables) can now display median, as well as arbitrary percentiles of numerical values




### [New feature: enhanced Python dataset read API](#id44)[¶](#new-feature-enhanced-python-dataset-read-api "Permalink to this heading")


The Python API to read datasets has been enhanced with numerous new capabilities and performance improvements.


The new fast\-path reading `Dataset.get_native_dataframe` method performs direct read from data sources. This provides massive performance improvements, especially when reading only a few columns out of a wide dataset. Fast\-path reading is available for:


* Parquet files stored in S3
* Snowflake tables/views


For regular reading, the following have been added:


* Ability to disable some thorough data checking, yielding performance improvements up to 50%
* Ability to read some columns as categoricals to reduce memory usage (depending on the data, can be up to 10\-100 times lower)
* Ability to use pandas “nullable integers”, allowing to read integer columns with missing values as integers (rather than floating\-point values)
* Ability to precisely match integer types to reduce memory usage (up to 8x for columns containing only tinyints)
* Added ability to completely override dtypes when reading


For samples and documentation, please see the [Developer Guide](https://developer.dataiku.com/latest/concepts-and-examples/datasets/datasets-data.html "(in Developer Guide)")




### [New feature: Builtin Git merging](#id45)[¶](#new-feature-builtin-git-merging "Permalink to this heading")


In addition to the existing ability to push projects and branches to remote Git repositories and perform merges there, you can now perform Git merges directly within Dataiku, including the ability to view and resolve merge conflicts




### [Behavior change: handling of schema mismatch on SQL datasets](#id46)[¶](#behavior-change-handling-of-schema-mismatch-on-sql-datasets "Permalink to this heading")


DSS will now by default refuse to drop SQL tables for managed datasets when the parent recipe is in append mode. In case of schema mismatch, the recipe now fails. This behavior can be reverted in the advanced settings of the output dataset
