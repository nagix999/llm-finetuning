### [Limitations and warnings](#id217)[¶](#limitations-and-warnings "Permalink to this heading")


Automatic migration from previous versions is supported (see above). Please pay attention to the following cautions, removal and deprecation notices.




### [Cautions](#id218)[¶](#cautions "Permalink to this heading")


* The SQL engine can now be automatically selected on prepare recipes. In case of issues on prepare recipes that were working prior to the upgrade, you can revert to the DSS engine by clicking on the “Engine: In database” button in the prepare recipe settings.
* Similarly, the Spark engine can now be automatically selected more eagerly when the storage and formats are compatible with fast Spark execution. In case of issues on recipes that were working prior to the upgrade, you can revert to the DSS engine by clicking on the “Engine: Spark” button in the recipe settings.
* The Bokeh package has been removed from the builtin Python environment. If you have Bokeh webapps, please make sure to use a code environment. The Bokeh package in the builtin Python environment was using a very old version of Bokeh.
* The Seaborn package has been removed from the builtin Python environment. If you use this package, please make sure to use a code environment.
* For Cloud Stacks setups, the OS for the DSS nodes has been updated from CentOS 7 to AlmaLinux 8 (which is a RedHat\-compatible distribution similar to CentOS). Custom setup actions may require some updates.
* For Cloud Stacks setups, R has been upgraded from R 3 to R 4\. You will need to rebuild all R code envs. Some updates to packages may be required
* For Cloud Stacks, the builtin Python environment has been upgraded from Python 3\.6 to Python 3\.9
* The version of some packages in the builtin Python environment have been upgraded and your code may require some updates if you are not using your own code environment. The most notable updates are:


	+ Pandas 0\.23 to 1\.3
	+ Numpy 1\.15 to 1\.21
	+ Scikit\-learn 0\.20 to 1\.0
	+ Matplotlib 2\.2 to 3\.6
* The python packages used by Visual Machine Learning have changed, in the built\-in code environment and in suggested packages. Notably, if you have KNN or SVM models trained using the built\-in code environment, you will need to retrain these models to be able to use them for scoring.

### [The LLM Mesh](#id419)[¶](#the-llm-mesh "Permalink to this heading")


With the recent advances in Generative AI and particularly large language models, new kind of applications are ready to be built, leveraging their power to structure natural language, generate new content, and provide powerful question answering capabilities.


However, there is a lack of oversight, governance, and centralization, which hinders deployment of LLM\-based applications.


The LLM Mesh is the common backbone for Enterprise Generative AI Applications.


It provides:


* Connectivity to a large number of Large Language Models, both as APIs or locally hosted
* Full permissioning of access to these LLMs, through new kinds of connections
* Full support for locally\-hosted HuggingFace models running on GPU
* Audit tracing
* Cost monitoring
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection and redaction
* Toxicity detection
* Caching
* Native support for Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern, using connections to Vector Stores and Embedding recipe.


The LLM Mesh is available in *Public Preview* in DSS 12\.3\.0\.


For more details, please see [Generative AI and LLM Mesh](../generative-ai/index.html).




### [Prompt Studios and LLM\-powered recipes](#id420)[¶](#prompt-studios-and-llm-powered-recipes "Permalink to this heading")


On top of the LLM Mesh, Dataiku now includes a full\-featured development environment for Prompt Engineering, the *Prompt Studio*. In the Prompt Studio, you can test and iterate on your prompts, compare prompts, compare various LLMs (either APIs or locally hosted), and, when satisfied, deploy your prompts as Prompt Recipes for large\-scale batch generation.


In addition, Dataiku now includes two new recipes that make it very easy to perform two common LLM\-powered tasks:


* Classifying text (either using classes that have been trained into the model, or classes that are provided by the user)
* Summarizing text


Prompt Studio and LLM\-powered recipes are available in *Public Preview* in DSS 12\.3\.0\.

* Send an email to the reviewers when the final approval is added and deleted
* Additionally, a new validation option has been added in the sign\-off configuration to prevent the workflow from going past an unapproved sign\-off step.


It also comes with UI improvements such as:


* Expand and collapse long feedback reviews
* Display the sign\-off description below the title
* Show the feedback and approver groups with details info on which users are configured


*Warning*: Some changes have been made to the API around the sign\-off feature, you need to pay attention to your usages of the Public API and, for Advanced Govern instances, the logical hooks around the sign\-off feature. Only for Advanced Govern instances, you may currently use logical hooks that are checking the sign\-off status (preventing the workflow from going past an unapproved sign\-off step) which will not work anymore in 12\.2\.0 due to the API changes. They can be replaced by the new validation option in the sign\-off configuration to prevent going past an unapproved sign\-off step. After enabling it, you will need to reset the corresponding sign\-offs and reload their configuration.

DSS 12\.0\.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with major new features.



### [Major new features](#id552)[¶](#major-new-features "Permalink to this heading")



#### [Machine Learning overrides](#id553)[¶](#machine-learning-overrides "Permalink to this heading")


ML models today can achieve very high levels of performance and reliability but unfortunately this is not the general
case, and often, they cannot be fully trusted for critical processes. There are many known reasons for this,
including overfitting, incomplete training data, outdated models, differences between testing environment and real world…


Model overrides allow you to add an extra layer of human control over the models’ predictions, to ensure that they:


* don’t predict outlandish values on critical systems,
* comply with regulations,
* enforce ethical boundaries.


By defining Overrides, you ensure that the model behaves in an expected manner under specific conditions.


Please see [Prediction Overrides](../machine-learning/supervised/prediction-overrides.html) for more details.




#### [Universal Feature Importance](#id554)[¶](#universal-feature-importance "Permalink to this heading")


While some models are interpretable by design, many advanced algorithms appear as black boxes to decision\-makers or even data scientists themselves. The new model\-agnostic global feature importance capabilities helps you:


* explain models that could not be explained until now
* explain models in an agnostic, comparable way (rather than only using algorithm specific methods)
* aggregate importance across categories of a single column
* assess relative direction (in addition to magnitude of importance)


This new feature extends and enhances the existing feature importance and individual explanation capabilities. It is fully based on Shapley values and enriched with state\-of\-the\-art visualisation


This capability is even available for MLflow models imported into DSS.




#### [Causal Prediction](#id555)[¶](#causal-prediction "Permalink to this heading")


The most common Data Science projects in Machine Learning involve predicting outcomes. However, in many cases, the focus shifts towards optimizing outcomes based on actionable variables rather than just predicting them. For example, you may desire to improve business results by identifying customers who will respond best to certain actions, rather than simply predicting which customers will churn.


Traditional prediction models are built with the assumption that their predictions will remain valid when actionable variables are manipulated. However, this assumption is often false, as there can be various reasons why acting on an actionable variable doesn’t have the expected outcome. For example, acting on one variable may have unforeseen consequences on other variables, or the distribution of the actionable variable may be unevenly distributed in the population, making it difficult to compare individuals with different values of the variable.


To address these challenges, the field of Causal Machine Learning (Causal ML) has emerged, incorporating econometric techniques into the Data Science toolbox. In Causal ML, a Data Scientist selects a treatment variable (such as a discount or an ad) and a control value to tag rows where the treatment was not received. Causal ML then performs additional steps to identify individuals who are likely to benefit the most from the treatment. This information can then be used for treatment allocation optimization, such as determining which customers are expected to respond most positively to a discount.


The Causal Prediction analysis available in the Lab provides a ready\-to\-use solution for training Causal models and using them to predict the effects of actionable variables, optimize interventions, and improve business outcomes.


Please see [Causal Prediction](../machine-learning/causal-prediction/index.html) for more details.




#### [Auto feature generation](#id556)[¶](#auto-feature-generation "Permalink to this heading")


The new “Generate Features” recipe makes it easy to enrich a dataset with new columns in order to improve the results of machine learning and analytics projects. You can define relationships between datasets in your project.


DSS will then automatically join, transform, and aggregate this data, ultimately creating new features.


Please see [Generate features](../other_recipes/generate-features.html) for more details.




#### [Data Collections and Data Catalog](#id557)[¶](#data-collections-and-data-catalog "Permalink to this heading")


Data collections allow you to gather key datasets by team or use case, so that users can easily find and share quality datasets to use in their projects.


Data Collections, Data Sources search and Connections explorer now live together as the new Data Catalog in DSS.




#### [Run subsequent recipes and on\-the\-fly schema propagation](#id558)[¶](#run-subsequent-recipes-and-on-the-fly-schema-propagation "Permalink to this heading")


For all intermediate recipes in a flow, when you click “run” from within the recipe, you now have an option to either:


* Run just that recipe
* Or run that recipe and all subsequent ones in the Flow, with the effect of making the whole “downstream” branch of the Flow up\-to\-date.


“Run this recipe and all subsequent ones” also applies schema changes on the fly to the output datasets, until the end of the Flow


It is now also possible, from the Flow, to build “downstream” (from left to right) all datasets that are after a given starting point. This also includes the ability to perform on\-the\-fly schema propagation




#### [Help Center](#id559)[¶](#help-center "Permalink to this heading")


Dataiku now includes a brand new integrated Help Center that provides comprehensive support, including a searchable database, onboarding materials, and step\-by\-step tutorials. It offers contextually relevant information based on the page you’re viewing, aiding in feature discovery and keeping you updated with the latest additions.


This Help Center serves as a one\-stop solution for all user needs, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.





### [Other notable enhancements and features](#id560)[¶](#other-notable-enhancements-and-features "Permalink to this heading")



#### [Build Flow Zones](#id561)[¶](#build-flow-zones "Permalink to this heading")


It is now possible to build an entire Flow zone. This builds all “final” datasets of this zone, and does not go beyond the boundary of the zone.




#### [Deployer permissions management upgrades](#id562)[¶](#deployer-permissions-management-upgrades "Permalink to this heading")


When deploying projects from the Deployer, it is now possible to choose the “Run as” user for scenarios and webapps in the deployed project on the automation node. This change can only be performed by the infrastructure administrator on the Deployer.


In addition, the infrastructure administrator on the Deployer can also configure:


* Under which identity projects are deployed to the automation node
* Whether to propagate the permissions from the project in the design node to the automation node




#### [Engine selection enhancements](#id563)[¶](#engine-selection-enhancements "Permalink to this heading")


Various enhancements were made to engine selection, so that users need to care much less often about which engines to select. In the vast majority of cases, we recommend that auto selection of engine is left to DSS, without manually selecting engines, or without setting prefered or forbidden engines.


The most notable changes are:


* Automatically select SQL engine for prepare recipes when possible and efficient (i.e. when both input and output are the same database)
* Do not automatically select Spark engine when it will for sure be inefficient (when the input or output cannot use fast Spark access)




#### [Prophet algorithm for Time Series Forecasting](#id564)[¶](#prophet-algorithm-for-time-series-forecasting "Permalink to this heading")


Visual Time Series Forecasting now includes the popular Prophet algorithm.




#### [API service monitoring wizard](#id565)[¶](#api-service-monitoring-wizard "Permalink to this heading")

#### [Request plugin installation](#id569)[¶](#request-plugin-installation "Permalink to this heading")


Users who are not admin can now request installation of a plugin from the plugin store. The request is then sent to administrators, and the user is notified when the request is processed.




#### [Request code env setup](#id570)[¶](#request-code-env-setup "Permalink to this heading")


Users who do not have the permission to create code envs can now request the setup of a code env from the code envs list. The request is then sent to administrators, and the user is notified when the request is processed.




#### [Model Document Generation for imported MLflow models](#id571)[¶](#model-document-generation-for-imported-mlflow-models "Permalink to this heading")


The automatic Model Document Generator now supports MLflow imported models.
