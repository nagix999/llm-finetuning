[Migration notes](#id61)[¶](#migration-notes "Permalink to this heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



### [Migration paths to DSS 4\.0](#id62)[¶](#migration-paths-to-dss-4-0 "Permalink to this heading")



> * From DSS 3\.1: Automatic migration is supported, with the restrictions and warnings described in [Limitations and warnings](#releases-notes-4-0-limitations)
> * From DSS 3\.0: In addition to the restrictions and warnings described in [Limitations and warnings](#releases-notes-4-0-limitations), you need to pay attention to the restrictions and warnings applying to DSS 3\.0\. See [3\.0 \-\> 3\.1](3.1.html)
> * From DSS 2\.X: In addition to the following restrictions and warnings, you need to pay attention
> to the restrictions and warnings applying to your previous versions: see [2\.0 \-\> 2\.1](2.1.html) [2\.1 \-\> 2\.2](2.2.html) [2\.2 \-\> 2\.3](2.3.html)
> [2\.3 \-\> 3\.0](3.0.html) and [3\.0 \-\> 3\.1](3.1.html)
> * Migration from DSS 1\.X is not supported. You must first upgrade to 2\.0\. See [DSS 2\.0 Relase notes](2.0.html)




### [How to upgrade](#id63)[¶](#how-to-upgrade "Permalink to this heading")


It is strongly recommended that you perform a full backup of your Data Science Studio data directory prior to starting the upgrade procedure.


For automatic upgrade information, see [Upgrading a DSS instance](../installation/custom/upgrade.html).


Pay attention to the warnings described in [Limitations and warnings](#releases-notes-4-0-limitations).




### [Limitations and warnings](#id64)[¶](#limitations-and-warnings "Permalink to this heading")


DSS 4\.0 is a major release, which changes some underlying workings of DSS. Automatic migration from previous versions is supported, but there are a few points that need manual attention.



#### [HiveServer2](#id65)[¶](#hiveserver2 "Permalink to this heading")


In Hadoop settings, previous versions of DSS didn’t use the HiveServer2 component. DSS now uses and requires HiveServer2 for all interaction with Hive. HiveServer2 is included by default in all Hadoop distributions. See [Hive](../hadoop/hive.html) for more information.


When migrating from previous versions, you need to setup the hostname of your HiveServer2 instance in Administration \> Settings \> Hadoop.




#### [Charts on SQL or Impala](#id66)[¶](#charts-on-sql-or-impala "Permalink to this heading")


The way charts engine is configured has been redesigned. You now first select the desired engine and DSS will show you errors if the engine is not compatible. While most of the charts that used to run on SQL (or Impala) will remain so, we recommend that you check all charts thata were supposed to run on SQL, and more generally all charts that use “full” sampling on datasets.




#### [Permissions](#id67)[¶](#permissions "Permalink to this heading")


The permissions system has been overhauled and new permission definitions have been introduced. DSS automatically migrates permissions to the new system. We recommend that you check all permissions, both for users and API keys.




#### [Dashboard](#id68)[¶](#dashboard "Permalink to this heading")


The new dashboard uses a new layout system, with a responsive grid instead of a fixed\-size one. You might need to tweak the layout of your existing dashboards.




#### [R](#id69)[¶](#r "Permalink to this heading")


After upgrading to DSS 4, you’ll need to re\-run `./bin/dssadmin install-R-integration` for R to work properly.




#### [Webapps](#id70)[¶](#webapps "Permalink to this heading")


Since the addition of the new dashboard, [Webapps](../webapps/index.html) have been moved to their own section in the UI. You’ll find the usual webapp editor in the “Notebooks” section of the project (“Web Apps” subtab)


For webapps that have a Python backend, make sure that the python backend file does not contain
[encoding magic comment](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/), such as:



```
# -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-

```


or:



```
# coding=utf-8

```


The old deprecated “/datasets/getcontent” API used by webapps prior to DSS 1\.0 has been removed. Very old webapps still using `dataiku_load_dataset()` or `dataiku_dataset_object` need to be migrated to new Webapps API.




#### [Other](#id71)[¶](#other "Permalink to this heading")


* Models trained with prior versions of DSS must be retrained when upgrading to 4\.0 (usual limitations on retraining models and regenerating API node packages \- see [Upgrading a DSS instance](../installation/custom/upgrade.html)). This includes models deployed to the flow (re\-run the training recipe), models in analysis (retrain them before deploying) and API package models (retrain the flow saved model and build a new package)
* After installation of the new version, R setup must be replayed
* We now recommend using mainly personal API keys for external applications controlling DSS, rather than project or global keys. Some operations, like creating datasets or recipes, are not always possible using non\-personal API keys.





### [External libraries upgrades](#id72)[¶](#external-libraries-upgrades "Permalink to this heading")


Several external libraries bundled with DSS have been bumped to major revisions. Some of these libraries include some *backwards\-incompatible* changes. You might need to upgrade your code.


Notable upgrades:


* scikit\-learn 0\.17 \-\> 0\.18
* matplotlib 1\.5 \-\> 2\.0


As usual, remember that you should not change the version of Python libraries bundled with DSS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DSS 4\.0\.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with a lot of new features and major architectural changes. For a summary of the major new features, see: <https://www.dataiku.com/learn/whatsnew>



### [New features](#id151)[¶](#new-features "Permalink to this heading")



#### [New dashboard](#id152)[¶](#new-dashboard "Permalink to this heading")


DSS 4 features a completely redesigned dashboard with far expanded capabilities.


* The dashboard now uses a 12\-cells responsive grid and a new layout engine that makes it much easier to move content around. The dashboard UX has been strongly overhauled.
* You can now have multiple dashboard per project. Dashboard can either be personal or public. Each dashboard can have multiple slides. The dashboard can be put in fullscreen mode
* Dashboard\-only users, who don’t have access to the full project content can now create their own dashboards. A new authorization system lets data analysts choose what part of the project are available to dashboard\-only users.
* A new publication system
* Many features have been added on published charts (show/hide axis, tooltips, legends, filters, ability for readers to set their own filters, …)
* Many features have been added on published datasets (show/hide headers, select columns, show colorization, ability for readers to set their own filters, …)
* Jupyter notebooks published on the dashboard can now have multiple versions, even concurrently.
* New kind of publishable insights have been added: report of a saved model, DSS metrics, project activity info, object activity feed.
* You can now add rich text, images, URLs and web pages directly on the dashboard.


For more information, see [Dashboards](../dashboards/index.html).




#### [Multi\-user security](#id153)[¶](#multi-user-security "Permalink to this heading")


The regular behavior of DSS is to run as a single UNIX account on its host machine. When a DSS end\-user executes a code recipe, it runs as this single UNIX user. Similarly, when a DSS end\-user executes an Hadoop recipe or notebook, it runs on the cluster as the Hadoop user of the DSS server.


DSS now supports an alternate mode of deployment, called *multi\-user security*. In this mode, DSS will *impersonate* the end\-user and run all user\-controlled code under its own identity.


For more information, see [User Isolation](../user-isolation/index.html)




#### [Spark 2](#id154)[¶](#spark-2 "Permalink to this heading")


DSS is now compatible with Spark 2\.0\. In addition, an experimental support for Spark 2\.1 is provided (preview only).


For more information, see [DSS and Spark](../spark/index.html)




#### [Spark pipelines](#id155)[¶](#spark-pipelines "Permalink to this heading")


When several consecutive steps in a DSS Flow (including with branches or splits) use the Spark engine, DSS now has the ability to automatically merge all of these recipes and run them as a single Spark job. This strongly boosts performance by avoiding needless writes and reads of intermediate datasets, and also alleviates Spark startup overheads.


The behavior of intermediate datasets can be configured by the user: write them or not (only the final datasets are written in that case).


For more information, see [Spark pipelines](../spark/pipelines.html)




#### [Sparklyr](#id156)[¶](#sparklyr "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now supports integration with sparklyr, an alternative API for using Spark from R code. The sparklyr integration cohabits with the SparkR integration. Both APIs are usable in recipes and notebooks.


For more information, see [Usage of Spark in DSS](../spark/usage.html)




#### [Interactive hierarchical clustering](#id157)[¶](#interactive-hierarchical-clustering "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now features a hierarchical clustering model. It has the unique feature of being “interactive”: rather than setting a fixed number of clusters, you can edit the hierarchy of clusters after training.


For example, if DSS has chosen to keep two clusters, but by studying them, you notice that the difference is not relevant to your problem, you can merge them. Oppositely, if a cluster contains two subpopulations that have relevant differences, you can split them to make deeper clusters.




#### [Quick models](#id158)[¶](#quick-models "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now includes a set of pre\-configured “model templates”. When you create a new model, you can now choose what kind of models you want:


* Very explainable models (based on simple decision trees or linear formulas)
* Most performant models, with highly cross\-validated algorithms and wide search for optimal parameters
* Models leading to finding most insights in your datasets (by fitting different kinds of algorithms)


You can still set all settings of all kinds of algorithms, but quick models allow you to get started faster with common business requirements.




#### [Distributed and in\-database scoring](#id159)[¶](#distributed-and-in-database-scoring "Permalink to this heading")


For most models created in DSS visual machine learning (with Python or MLLib backends),
you can now run scoring recipes:


* In distributed mode, on Spark
* In SQL databases, without data movement


This new feature strongly improves scalability of machine learning model application.




#### [Notifications \& Integrations](#id160)[¶](#notifications-integrations "Permalink to this heading")


The notifications system in DSS has been greatly overhauled to adapt better to larger teams.


* You can now “watch” every kind of object in DSS (dataset, recipe, analysis, whole project, …) and get notified when updates are available (someone modified the recipe, a new comment has been posted, …). In your profile, you can edit which objects you watch.
* A brand new “personal” drawer (click on your user image) which shows all of your notifications, your profile, …
* In addition to receiving your notifications in your personal drawer, each user can also choose to receive “offline” summaries (what happened on your watched objects while you were away from DSS) or daily digests (each morning, get a summary of what happened on your watched objects).
* DSS can push notifications to third party systems. Slack and Hipchat integrations are provided and more will follow. You can also connect DSS with Github so that commit messages in DSS can close Github issues.
* A new “activity” drawer shows all your running activities (jobs, scenarios, notebooks, webapp backends, macros, and other long tasks).




#### [New prebuilt notebooks](#id161)[¶](#new-prebuilt-notebooks "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now comes with 4 new prebuilt notebooks for analyzing datasets:


* Distribution analysis and statistical tests on a single numerical population
* Distribution analysis and statistical tests on multiple population groups
* High\-dimensionality data visualization using t\-SNE
* Topics modeling using NMF and LDA




#### [Sort in explore](#id162)[¶](#sort-in-explore "Permalink to this heading")


The explore view (also data preparation view in analysis and prepare recipe) can now be sorted, according to a single or multiple criterions.


This sort is only visual and on the sample. The original data is not sorted.




#### [Analyze on whole dataset in explore](#id163)[¶](#analyze-on-whole-dataset-in-explore "Permalink to this heading")


The “Analyze” view in Explore can now be based on the whole dataset (in addition to the exploration sample). This is available on all dataset types and will automatically run in database, Hive or Impala depending on the type of dataset and available engines. See [Analyze](../explore/analyze.html) for more information.




#### [New data sources](#id164)[¶](#new-data-sources "Permalink to this heading")


DSS can now connect to:


* Google Cloud Storage (read and write)
* Azure Blob Storage (read and write)




#### [Audit trail](#id165)[¶](#audit-trail "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now includes a full applicative audit trail of all activities performed by all users. With appropriate configuration, this audit trail is non repudiable: even if a user manages to compromise DSS, traces leading up to the compromise will not be alterable.




#### [Macros](#id166)[¶](#macros "Permalink to this heading")


Macros are predefined actions that allow you to automate a variety of tasks, like:


* Maintenance and diagnostic tasks
* Specific connectivity tasks for import of data
* Generation of various reports, either about your data or DSS


Macros can either run either manually or from a scenario. Some macros are provided as part of DSS, and they can also be in a plugin or developed by you.


For example, the following macros are provided as part of DSS:


* Generate an audit report of which connections are used
* List and mass\-delete datasets by tag filters
* Clear internal DSS databases
* Clear old DSS job logs


More information is available at [DSS Macros](../operations/macros.html)




#### [Sample and prepare memory limits](#id167)[¶](#sample-and-prepare-memory-limits "Permalink to this heading")


The DSS administrator can now set maximum memory size for the design samples and the memory size occupied by memory representation of intermediate steps in a visual preparation recipe or analysis. This strongly incrases the stability and resilience of DSS, especially when users try to create huge design samples.


Limits are configured in Administration \> Settings \> Limits





### [Other notable enhancements](#id168)[¶](#other-notable-enhancements "Permalink to this heading")



#### [Machine learning](#id169)[¶](#id42 "Permalink to this heading")

#### [Sampling](#id170)[¶](#sampling "Permalink to this heading")


New sampling modes have been introduced:


* Exact “random count of records”: get exactly the count you asked for
* “Last records”
* Stratified sampling versus a target column


Note that some of these sampling methods are only available for explore, analyze and prepare recipes, not in the sampling recipe.


In addition:


* “Random count of records” sampling is now up to 2 times faster.
* It is now possible to define a filter within the sampling.
* It is now possible to use “last N partitions” as a partition selection method in sampling


For more information, see:

* It is now possible to set the line width for line charts




#### [Coding recipes](#id172)[¶](#coding-recipes "Permalink to this heading")


* Advanced options and statements splitting capabilities have been added to the SQL Query recipe. See [SQL recipes](../code_recipes/sql.html) for more information. This makes it easier to do advanced things like stored procedures or CTEs in SQL recipes.
* SQL script recipes can now automatically infer output schema, like SQL query recipes. See [SQL recipes](../code_recipes/sql.html) for more information
* SparkSQL recipes can now use the global Hive metastore, alternatively to using only the local datasets. See [SparkSQL recipes](../code_recipes/sparksql.html) for more information
* You can now disable validation of code prior to running recipes. This is useful for some kinds of recipes where validation can be very slow.




#### [Visual recipes](#id173)[¶](#visual-recipes "Permalink to this heading")


* The Sync, Filter/Sample and Split recipes can now run on Spark, Hive, SQL and Impala
* The window recipe can now work on any kind of dataset, even if you don’t have Spark.
* Administrators can now set preferred engines, blacklisted engines
* The Join recipe can now be configured to automatically select all columns of some datasets, even when their schema changes.
* The join and stack recipes can now automatically downcast columns to match types




#### [Security](#id174)[¶](#id43 "Permalink to this heading")


* In addition to multi\-user security and audit\-trail, the permissions system has been overhauled and new permission definitions have been introduced. You can now define thinner\-grained group permissions at the project level. See [Main project permissions](../security/permissions.html).
* More options are available for sharing items between projects, and authorizing objects on dashboards. See [Shared objects](../security/shared-objects.html).
* User profiles can now be set directly from LDAP groups.
* The details of connections can now be made available to some groups, who can then use them in recipes
* Connection passwords are now encrypted on disk using a reversible encryption scheme




#### [Datasets](#id175)[¶](#id44 "Permalink to this heading")


* Administrator can now set preferred connections and file formats when creating new managed datasets.
* It is now possible to import SQL tables as SQL datasets from the DSS UI, without being an administrator. Go to New dataset \> Import from connection. This is also possible for Hive tables.
* When a HDFS dataset has been imported from an existing Hive table, it is possible to “update” the definition of the dataset from the associated Hive table definition in the Hive metastore
* The filtering infrastructure (used in filter recipe, for filtering in sample, in APIs, …) now more directly translates user\-defined filters to SQL. This provides more efficient filtering in SQL and less timezone\-related issues.
* Support for ElasticSearch 5 has been added
* It is now possible to define a dataset based on the files in a DSS managed folder.
* The “internal stats” dataset now includes ability to view jobs information and build informatino
* Teradata connections can now be put in “autocommit” mode, which makes it much easier to write DDL statements, use stored procedures, write stored procedures or use third\-party plugins.
* In\-database charts are now available for Teradata.
* Teradata datasets will more often avoid going over the Teradata max row size limitations
* Sorting, searching, and mass actions have been added to the schema editor




#### [Library editor and per project library](#id176)[¶](#library-editor-and-per-project-library "Permalink to this heading")


You can now write / add your own Python modules or packages in per\-project library paths in addition to the global “lib/python” one. In addition, you can edit both the global and per\-project “lib/python” folders directly from the DSS UI.


You can also edit a new “lib/R” folder, which can be used to import R source files.




#### [Hadoop \& Spark](#id177)[¶](#id45 "Permalink to this heading")


* It is now possible to import Hive tables as HDFS datasets from the DSS UI, without being an administrator. Go to New dataset \> Import from connection.
* The Spark\-Scala recipe now features a new “function” mode which allows the recipe to be part of a Spark pipeline
* You can now run SparkSQL recipes against the global Hive metastore. Note that this disables automatic validation.
* You can now manage multiple named Hive configurations, used to pass additional Hive parameters on recipes and notebooks




#### [Data preparation](#id178)[¶](#id46 "Permalink to this heading")


* The “Round” processor can now round to a fixed number of decimal places
* The “Pivot” processor can now keep repeated values
* New meaning: “Currency amount” (i.e. a currency symbol and a numeric amount), with an associated processor to split currency and amount. This is particularly useful in conjunction with the existing currency converter processor
* Holidays database have been updated and improved
* User agents parsing has been updated and improved




#### [Flow](#id179)[¶](#id47 "Permalink to this heading")


* The “Consistency check” Flow tool has been greatly enhanced. It can now check many more kinds of recipes, and perform more structural checks
* A new “engines” flow view let you see easily on which engine (DSS, SQL, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, …) each of your recipes run.
* You can now copy recipes
* You can now change the input / output datasets of all recipes




#### [Version control](#id180)[¶](#version-control "Permalink to this heading")


DSS now features the ability to rollback configuration changes from the UI. We advise great care when rolling back changes.


You can also manage “Git remotes” directly from the DSS UI, including pushing to remotes. The public API features a new method to push to remotes.




#### [API](#id181)[¶](#id48 "Permalink to this heading")


In addition to the previously existing project\-specific and global API keys, DSS now features “personal” API keys. Personal API keys have the same rights has their owner. In some setups, creating datasets and recipes can only be done using Admin or Personal API keys.


The internal API (`dataiku` package) can now automatically call the public API. To obtain an API client, use `dataiku.api_client()`.


The public API now includes methods for:


* Getting and setting general DSS settings
* Managing installed plugins
* Monitoring and aborting “futures” (long\-running tasks)
* Getting metrics


For more information, see [Public REST API](../publicapi/index.html)




#### [Plugins](#id182)[¶](#plugins "Permalink to this heading")
