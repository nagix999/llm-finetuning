Continuous sync[¶](#continuous-sync "Permalink to this heading")
================================================================


A continuous Sync recipe processes messages from a streaming endpoint and passes them either to another streaming endpoint, or stores them in a dataset. The main use is to capture a stream into a dataset, to perform analyses on it.


A continuous sync recipe offers exactly\-once guarantees when the following conditions are met:


* the input streaming endpoint is replayable
* the output can be atomically checkpointed


A example of such a case is when the input is a Kafka streaming endpoint and the output a file\-based dataset.



Partitioning[¶](#partitioning "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------


If the output dataset is partitioned with a single time dimension, then the continuous sync recipe writes the messages in a partition corresponding to the time where the message was received from the streaming endpoint. For example, with an hourly partitioning, messages arriving between 2020\-07\-11 08:00:00 and 2020\-07\-11 08:59:59 will go into the 2020\-07\-11\-08 partition.
