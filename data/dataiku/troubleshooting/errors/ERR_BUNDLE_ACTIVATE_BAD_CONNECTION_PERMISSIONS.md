ERR\_BUNDLE\_ACTIVATE\_BAD\_CONNECTION\_PERMISSIONS: Connection is not freely usable[¶](#err-bundle-activate-bad-connection-permissions-connection-is-not-freely-usable "Permalink to this heading")
====================================================================================================================================================================================================


The project you are trying to import/activate has a dependency on connection(s) that either you are not able to use or have been remapped to connection(s) that you are not able to use.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


Use the connection remapping option, and map the connection(s) to ones that you are able to use.
The connection remapping is available for both project import (tick the `Display advanced options after upload`) and bundle activation (in the `Activation settings` tab of the bundles management screen).
