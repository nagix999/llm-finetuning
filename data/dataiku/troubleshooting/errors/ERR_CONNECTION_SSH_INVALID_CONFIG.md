===================================================================================================================================================================================


DSS tried to connect to the SSH server but the configuration seems invalid.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator.


The first step for solving this issue is to go to the settings screen for the affected connection (Administration \> Connections). You can test the connection from there.


* Refer to the [documentation on SCP / SFTP (aka SSH)](../../connecting/scp-sftp.html) in order to get additional information
* Make sure that the connection settings are correct
