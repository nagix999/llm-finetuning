ERR\_PLUGIN\_WITHOUT\_CODEENV: The plugin has no code env specification[¶](#err-plugin-without-codeenv-the-plugin-has-no-code-env-specification "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================================================================================================================


The user has requested the update of the code env of a plugin, but no code env is setup for that plugin.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator.


A code env for the plugin needs to be created first, by going to the Administration \> Plugins list and setuping the plugins dependencies.
