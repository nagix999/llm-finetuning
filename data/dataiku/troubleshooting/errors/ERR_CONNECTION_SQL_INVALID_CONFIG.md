ERR\_CONNECTION\_SQL\_INVALID\_CONFIG: Invalid SQL connection configuration[¶](#err-connection-sql-invalid-config-invalid-sql-connection-configuration "Permalink to this heading")
===================================================================================================================================================================================


DSS tried to connect to a SQL database but the configuration seems invalid.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator


The first step for solving this issue is to go to the settings screen for the affected connection (Administration \> Connections). You can test the connection from there.


* Refer to the [documentation on SQL databases](../../connecting/sql/index.html) in order to get additional information on the support of your specific database by DSS.
* Make sure that the connection settings are correct
