ERR\_CODEENV\_NO\_CREATION\_PERMISSION: User not allowed to create Code environments[¶](#err-codeenv-no-creation-permission-user-not-allowed-to-create-code-environments "Permalink to this heading")
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================


The current user does not have permissions to create code environments.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator.


The administrator needs to give permission to that user to create code environments.
This is done at the group level, so that user needs to be put in a group that has
that permission set. See also [Main project permissions](../../security/permissions.html).
