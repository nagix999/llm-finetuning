Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


The plugin has been removed so there are 2 cases:

* the removal is not intentional : this issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator, either by reinstalling the plugin or by reverting the plugins/dev to a previous state.
