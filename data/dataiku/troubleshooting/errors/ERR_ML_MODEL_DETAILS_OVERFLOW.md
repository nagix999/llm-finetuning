ERR\_ML\_MODEL\_DETAILS\_OVERFLOW: Model details exceed size limit[¶](#err-ml-model-details-overflow-model-details-exceed-size-limit "Permalink to this heading")
=================================================================================================================================================================


Some details of this model require more memory than allowed, so DSS stopped reading those details to prevent
a large memory consumption by the backend.


This happens when the files containing details about the model are bigger than the allowed quota.
There are two usual underlying causes to this:


* This model is computed on a dataset with a very large number of columns
* This model is tree\-based, has a very large number of nodes (numerous and/or very deep trees)



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


As a user, you can try reducing the size of the model (less columns, less trees, shallower trees).


A DSS administrator can also change the quota for this error, by setting the value of
`dku.fileSizeLimit.modelDetailJson` in `config/dip.properties` in the data directory.
Specify the quota in bytes, defaults to 52428800 (i.e. 50 MB).


If this does not solve your issue, please report the issue to Dataiku support.
