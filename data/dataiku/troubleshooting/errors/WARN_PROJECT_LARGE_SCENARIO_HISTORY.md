WARN\_PROJECT\_LARGE\_SCENARIO\_HISTORY: Projects \- Too old or too many scenario run logs[¶](#warn-project-large-scenario-history-projects-too-old-or-too-many-scenario-run-logs "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================


There are projects in your Dataiku instance that have too many scenario runs logs (more than 1000\) or that have scenario runs logs that are too old (60\+ days\-old). This can cause performance issues and fills up your disk space.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


Manually delete the scenario runs logs or run the **Clear scenario runs logs** macro.
