ERR\_BUNDLE\_ACTIVATE\_CONNECTION\_NOT\_WRITABLE: Connection is not writable[¶](#err-bundle-activate-connection-not-writable-connection-is-not-writable "Permalink to this heading")
====================================================================================================================================================================================


The project you are trying to import/duplicate contains dataset(s) located on read only connection(s).



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


Use the connection remapping option, and map the read only connection(s) to one you have write permission to.
The connection remapping is available for both project import (tick the `Display advanced options after upload`) or project duplication (under the `Advanced options` menu).
