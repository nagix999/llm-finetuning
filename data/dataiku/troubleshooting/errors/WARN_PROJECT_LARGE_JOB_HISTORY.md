WARN\_PROJECT\_LARGE\_JOB\_HISTORY: Projects \- Too old or too many job logs[¶](#warn-project-large-job-history-projects-too-old-or-too-many-job-logs "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================================================================================================================================


There are projects in your Dataiku instance that have too many job logs (more than 1000\) or that have job logs that are too old (60\+ days\-old). This can cause performance issues and fills up your disk space.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


Manually delete the job logs or run the **Clear job logs** macro.
