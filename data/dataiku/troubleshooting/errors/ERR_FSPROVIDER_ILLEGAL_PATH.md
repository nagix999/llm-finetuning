ERR\_FSPROVIDER\_ILLEGAL\_PATH: Illegal path for that file system[¶](#err-fsprovider-illegal-path-illegal-path-for-that-file-system "Permalink to this heading")
================================================================================================================================================================


The specified path is not supported on that file system.


For example, `.` and `..` are not usable on an S3 file system.
S3 is not an actual file system. It identifies objects with keys,
which may or may not look like a path on a file system. You can have a single
object with key `a/b/c.txt`, which will be presented by many tools, DSS included,
as a folder `a`, containing a folder `b`, containing a file `c.txt`.
Having a `.` or `..` in a key will not work as on a Unix\- or Windows\-style
file system and is therefore not supported.



Remediation[¶](#remediation "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------


Fix the faulty path. If that path was set at the connection level, you will need
DSS administrator access to fix it.
