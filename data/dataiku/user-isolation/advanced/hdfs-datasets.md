HDFS datasets data structure[¶](#hdfs-datasets-data-structure "Permalink to this heading")
==========================================================================================



Note


This only applies for HDFS datasets for which ACL synchronization is used.



When user isolation for Hadoop is disabled, datasets location is specified by a path in a connection.


When user isolation for Hadoop is enabled, DSS uses a different files pattern for managed datasets: if the dataset’s configured location is `/user/dataiku/datasets/MYPROJECT/mydataset`, then the actual data is written in `/user/dataiku/datasets/MYPROJECT/mydataset/data`.


The “data” folder belongs to the last user who wrote the dataset (this might be “hive” or “impala”). The “mydataset” folder always belongs to the `dssuser` user.


ACLs preventing access are on the `mydataset` folder. Within that folder, it is normal for data files to have world\-readable permissions. The restrictive “gateway” ACLs on `mydataset` prevent unauthorized users from accessing them.


This behavior is configured in the settings of the HDFS connection, in the “Write ACL synchronization mode” setting.
