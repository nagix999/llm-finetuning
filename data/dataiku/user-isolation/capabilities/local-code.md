Local code isolation[¶](#local-code-isolation "Permalink to this heading")
==========================================================================


Local code isolation is the fundamental component of User Isolation Framework.


Each time a user submits code to be executed by DSS, DSS will use *sudo* to execute the code as this end\-user. Standard UNIX permissions and isolation guarantee that the user cannot access any forbidden information in the DSS data dir.
