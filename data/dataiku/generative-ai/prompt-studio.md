The Prompt Studio[Â¶](#the-prompt-studio "Permalink to this heading")
====================================================================


Dataiku features a full\-featured development environment for Prompt Engineering, the *Prompt Studio*. In the Prompt Studio, you can test and iterate on your prompts, compare prompts, compare various LLMs (either APIs or locally hosted), and, when satisfied, deploy your prompts as Prompt Recipes for large\-scale batch generation.


The Prompt Studio sits on top of the LLM Mesh and all benefits of the LLM Mesh fully apply to Prompt Studios.


Prompt Studios are created by clicking on the Green menu.
