Creating static insights[¶](#creating-static-insights "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================================


In DSS code recipes and notebooks, you can create static insights: data files that are created by code and that can be rendered on the dashboard.


This capability can notably be used to embed in one click charts created using:


* [ggplot2](../R/ggplot2.html)
* [dygraphs](../R/dygraphs.html)
* [ggvis](../R/ggvis.html)
* [googleVis](../R/googlevis.html)


You can also use it for embedding in the dashboard any kind of content (image, HTML, …)


The API reference for creating insights in R can be found in the documentation of the `dataiku` package: <https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/api/13/R/dataiku/reference>
