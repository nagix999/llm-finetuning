Sampling[¶](#sampling "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================


When exploring and preparing data in DSS, you always get immediate visual feedback, no matter how big the dataset that you are manipulating. To achieve this, DSS works on a sample of your dataset.


In the visual data preparation, all transformation steps that you define are executed on the sample and the results are presented to you right away. When you export the processed data or create a recipe to insert your preparation script in your data flow, the whole input dataset is processed.


When you create a new visual data preparation (either in a visual analysis or a prepare recipe), by default, the sample that was used in the “Explore” part is kept.
