Flag holidays[¶](#flag-holidays "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================


This processor identifies whether a date is a school holiday, a bank
holiday or a weekend.


It takes as input a Date column and outputs 3 boolean columns :


* `*school`: whether this date is a school holiday or not. (FR)
* `*bank`: whether this date is a bank holiday or not. (FR,US,IN,DE,ES)
* `*weekend`: whether this date is a weekend or not.


It’s worth noting that a Date in DSS corresponds to a point in time,
just like a timestamp. Conversely, a holiday is always defined by a
timezone\-less tuple (year,month,day). Consequently, a timezone must be
provided in order to convert this timezone\-less representation into a
Date.


Although the timezone can be specified explicitly, it may be more
convenient to use the country’s default timezone.




| Country | Default timezone |
| --- | --- |
| DE | Europe/Berlin |
| ES | Europe/Madrid |
| FR | Europe/Paris |
| IN | Asia/Kolkata |
| US | America/New\_York |


If you need to retrieve bank holidays and/or weekends in other countries, please use the “Holidays” plugin.
