Compute difference between dates[¶](#compute-difference-between-dates "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================================================


Compute the difference between an ISO\-8601 formatted date column (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`) and another time reference: the current time, a fixed date, or another column.



Options[¶](#options "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------


**Time since column**


Column containing data in ISO\-8601 format. Use a Prepare step to parse your data into this format if it isn’t already.


**Until**


Choose the second time reference to compute the difference — now, another date column, or a fixed date.


**Output time unit**


Determine the unit of time in which to express the datetime difference — year, month, week, day, hour, minute or second.


**Output column**


Column into which the datetime difference will be written.


**Reverse output**


Multiply the computed difference by \-1, reversing it: `3 days` → `-3 days`.
