Impute with computed value[¶](#impute-with-computed-value "Permalink to this heading")
======================================================================================


This processor imputes missing values with mean, median or mode.


The mean is the sum of values of a data set divided by number of values. This is what is most often meant by an average.


The median is the middle value separating the greater and lesser halves of a set of values


The mode is the most frequent value in a set of values


For example, given the values `1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9`:



> * Mean is `4` ((1\+2\+2\+3\+4\+7\+9\) / 7\)
> * Median is `3` (1, 2, 2 – **3** – 4, 7, 9\)
> * Mode is `2` (1, **2**, **2**, 3, 4, 7, 9\)
