Extract ngrams[¶](#extract-ngrams "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================


This processor extracts sequences of words, called *ngrams*, from a text
column.



What are ngrams ?[¶](#what-are-ngrams "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------


For example, for text ‘the quick brown fox jumps’, the ngrams are:


* ngrams of size 2 (also called 2\-grams) : the quick, quick brown,
brown fox, fox jumps
* ngrams of size 3 (also called 3\-grams): the quick brown, quick brown
fox, brown fox jumps




Example use case[¶](#example-use-case "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------


You want to perform statistics on the sequence of words used in a query
log.




Output[¶](#output "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------


The NGram extractor offers several output modes:


* Convert to JSON: A JSON array containing the ngrams is generated,
either in the input column or in another column. This mode is most
useful if you intend to perform some custom processing and need to
retain the structure of the original text.
* One ngram per row: in this mode, for each ngram, a new row is
generated. The row contains a copy of all other columns in the
original row. This mode is most useful if you intend to group by
ngram afterwards.
* One ngram per column: in this mode, a new column is generated for
each ngram. For example, if a column contains 4 words, you ask for
2\-grams, and you use ‘out\_’ as prefix, columns ‘out\_0’, ‘out\_1’
and ‘out\_2’ will be generated.




Simplification[¶](#simplification "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------


Very often, you’ll want to simplify the text to remove some variance in
your text corpus. This processor offers several possible simplifications
on the text before extracting ngrams.


* Normalize text: transforms to lowercase, removes accents and performs
Unicode normalization (Café \-\> cafe)
* Clear stop words: remove so\-called ‘stop words’ (the, I, a, of, …).
This transformation is language\-specific and requires you to enter
the language of your column.
* Stem words: transforms each word into its ‘stem’, ie its grammatical
root. For example, ‘grammatical’ is transformed to ‘grammat’. This
transformation is language\-specific and requires you to enter the
language of your column.
* Sort words alphabetically: sorts all words of the text. For example,
‘the small dog’ is transformed to ‘dog small the’. This allows you to
match together strings that are written with the same words in a
different order.


Note: it is strongly advised to clear stop words before extracting
ngrams




Advanced options[¶](#advanced-options "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------


* Split on sentence boundaries: Generally, you don’t want to compute
cross\-sentence ngrams. For example, with text ‘The rain falls. The
sun shines’, you don’t want to generate ‘falls the’ as a ngram.
* Compute skip\-grams : In our sample sentence, the skip\-grams would be:
the brown, the fox, the jumps, quick fox, quick jumps, … Enabling
skip\-grams computation dramatically increases output size and
computation requirements.
