Classify User\-Agent[¶](#classify-user-agent "Permalink to this heading")
=========================================================================


This processor parses and extracts information from a browser’s User\-Agent string.


The following columns are created and may or may not be filled depending on the user agents:


* ‘type’: one of:



> * ‘browser’ (desktop OS)
> * ‘tablet’
> * ‘phone’
> * ‘mobile’ (could be either a tablet or phone)
> * ‘bot’ (crawlers, spam, …)
> * ‘library’ (wget, urllib2, …)
> * ‘rss’ : RSS feed readers
> * ‘unknown’


* ‘brand’: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Android, …
* ‘category’: Quite like brand, but tries to distinguish browsers of the same brand that behave differently. For example, IE8 and IE9 are the same brand, but different categories
* ‘version’
* ‘os’ : Operating system
* ‘osversion’ : Version of the Operating system
* ‘osflavor’ : Variant of the Operating System (Linux distribution,
32/64 bits, …)
