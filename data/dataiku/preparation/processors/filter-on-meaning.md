Filter invalid rows/cells[¶](#filter-invalid-rows-cells "Permalink to this heading")
====================================================================================


Filter rows from the dataset with invalid values, i.e. those that are invalid for the selected meaning. Alternatively, this processor can clear content from invalid cells instead of filtering entire rows.


Meaning is semantic information about the data and is usually automatically detected from the content of the column: URL, IP Address, Country. As such, each cell can be valid or invalid for a given meaning.
