----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you are an Admin of a Data Collection, you can also add or remove DSS users and groups from the collection and change their roles.
This feature is available with the “Edit security settings” option in the “…” menu of a Data Collection.




Data Collection Roles[¶](#data-collection-roles "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Within a Data Collection, there are 3 types of roles: **Admins, Contributors, and Readers.**


* **Admins** control access to the Data Collection by adding and removing users and assigning them roles (Admin, Contributor or Reader). They can also edit the Data Collection settings or delete the Data Collection.
* **Contributors** can publish datasets to the Data Collection or remove them. In order to publish a dataset from a DSS project, a Contributor needs to have permission from the project owner; this is granted at the project level, separately from Data Collection membership. See [Publishing to a Data Collection](publish-to-data-collection.html) for more information.
* **Readers** can access and interact with the content of the Data Collection.
