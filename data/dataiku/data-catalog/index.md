Data Catalog[¶](#data-catalog "Permalink to this heading")
==========================================================


The **Data Catalog** is a central place for analysts, data scientists, and other collaborators to share and search for datasets across their organization.


From the Data Catalog homepage, which you can find in the Applications menu on the top right, you can search for data in three categories:


* Data Collections
* Datasets \& Indexed Tables
* Connections Explorer


At the bottom of the homepage you can also find **Popular Datasets**, which are datasets that are considered the most relevant for publication or reuse.


The Data Catalog can be accessed from the Application menu, or from a project using the “Search and import” option of the new dataset menu (other options can bring you directly to a sub\-section of the catalog).
