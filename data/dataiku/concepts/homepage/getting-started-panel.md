Getting Started With DSS Panel[¶](#getting-started-with-dss-panel "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================================================


**Getting Started With DSS** is a sliding panel found at the bottom of the personal homepage. By default, this provides links to the Getting Started portal on Dataiku’s website, where you can access written and video tutorials, sign up for weekly demos, and visit the gallery of sample projects.


This section also allows your Dataiku DSS administrator to [select wiki pages to be used as “home articles”](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/collaboration/wiki.html#home-articles) to convey the organization, procedures, and guidelines for using the instance and projects on the instance. You can see the homepage articles that are based on wikis in projects you have access to.
