Changing the Order of Sections on the Homepage[¶](#changing-the-order-of-sections-on-the-homepage "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================================================================================


If you primarily use Dataiku DSS for work on projects, the default ordering is suitable. You can change the order of sections, or remove sections, by going to **User Center \> Profile and Settings**.


On the **My Settings** tab, under **Homepage layout** drag sections into the desired order, and remove sections that aren’t needed (sections can be added back later).
