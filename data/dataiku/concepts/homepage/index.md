Homepage[¶](#homepage "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================


After logging in, you are taken to the Dataiku DSS homepage. The homepage is designed to prominently display the information most relevant to you.


For example, if you are a:


* New designer user on a Dataiku DSS instance, you want general information on the organization, procedures, and guidelines for using the instance;
* Data scientist, you want the projects you’re currently working on;
* Data consumer without project access, you are taken to [Workspaces page](../../workspaces/index.html) that have been designed to give you an easy access to shared assets.


Regardless of your role on the team, as the number of projects on the instance grows, you’ll want immediate access to the projects and objects within a project that you’ve been working on.
