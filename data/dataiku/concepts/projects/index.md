Projects[¶](#projects "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================


A Dataiku DSS project is a container for all your work on a particular activity.


Each project has a single [Flow](../../flow/index.html) that shows the pipeline of datasets and recipes associated with the project.


The project home acts as the command center from which you can see the overall status of a project,
view recent activity, and collaborate through comments, tags, and a project to\-do list.
It is also where the project’s **Actions** menu resides. From the **Actions** menu, you can:


* [Duplicate](duplicate.html) a project
* Export a project to a ZIP file
* Delete a project
