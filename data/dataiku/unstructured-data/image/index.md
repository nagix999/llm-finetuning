Images[¶](#images "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================


Some common tasks when working with images include: feature extraction, classification, image segmentation, object recognition…


Dataiku natively integrates the following capabilities:


* [Computer vision in Visual ML](../../machine-learning/computer-vision/index.html): Perform [image classification](https://knowledge.dataiku.com/latest/ml-analytics/images/classification-visual/tutorial-index.html) and object detection in a visual way, no code needed.
* [Deep learning in Visual ML](../../machine-learning/deep-learning/index.html): Build deep learning models in Keras in a semi\-visual way.


In addition, you can leverage any image processing library with Python or R code in Dataiku.
