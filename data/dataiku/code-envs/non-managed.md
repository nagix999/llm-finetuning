Non\-managed code environments[¶](#non-managed-code-environments "Permalink to this heading")
=============================================================================================


When a completely custom Python or R installation is needed, DSS can let the user maintain code environment directly. In this case, the code environment is “non\-managed” from the point of view of DSS. To create such an environment:


* go to Administration \> Code envs
* create a new Python or R environment
* select “Non\-managed path” as environment type
* Give an identifier to your code environment. Only use A\-Z, a\-z, digits and hyphens



Note


Code environment identifiers must be globally unique to the DSS instance, so use a complete and descriptive identifier



A non\-managed code environment is basically a folder created by DSS. Its path can be found on the code environment’s General tab, as “Location of the environment”.

DSS requires the presence in the location of the non\-managed code environment of the following files:


* bin/python : a python executable
* bin/pip : a script to list the packages, that will be called with the arguments “bin/python bin/pip freeze \-l”




Non\-managed R code environment[¶](#non-managed-r-code-environment "Permalink to this heading")
