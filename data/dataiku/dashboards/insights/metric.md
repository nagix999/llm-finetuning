Metric[¶](#metric "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================


The metric insight allows you to publish a [metric](../../metrics-check-data-quality/metrics.html) about any supported object (dataset, saved model, managed folder or model evaluation store).



Publishing a metric insight[¶](#publishing-a-metric-insight "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can publish a metric insight from several locations:



### From the metrics view[¶](#from-the-metrics-view "Permalink to this heading")



Note


This method is only possible if you have at least the “Read project content” permission.



From the metrics view, either in a dataset, saved model or managed folder, you can click on the caret next to each metric, and click Publish

### From the dashboard[¶](#from-the-dashboard "Permalink to this heading")


Click on the \+ button to add tiles. Select metric, then select the data source for which you want to display a metric. If you only have dashboard access, you will only see the datasets, models and folders that have previously been [dashboard\-authorized](../../security/authorized-objects.html).


Choose the metric to display. You can only add metrics which have already been computed.





Tile display[¶](#tile-display "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------


The tile can display either:


* The current value of the metric as a large display (either a number, a histogram or a list of values).
* The history values

View insight[¶](#view-insight "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------


The full\-size view of the insight always displays the history value of the metric.


No edition is possible on the metric insight.
