ESRI Shapefiles[¶](#esri-shapefiles "Permalink to this heading")
================================================================


DSS can parse ESRI shapefiles. You can either use a folder containing all the required files, or a .shp.zip



Vecmath library[¶](#vecmath-library "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------


Shapefiles can contain data in a very large number of projections. Some projections require advanced math to parse. This capability is provided by a library called **Vecmath**. Vecmath is also required for some projections handling in data preparation


Vecmath is a GPL library. For licensing reasons, DSS is not provided with Vecmath. To open some Shapefiles, you need to download and install Vecmath manually. Please install vecmath\-1\.3\.1\.jar or later.


* Download it from MVN repository and review the licensing terms: [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.vecmath/vecmath/1\.5\.2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.vecmath/vecmath/1.5.2)
* Put the downloaded jar in DSS\_DATA\_DIR/lib/jdbc
* Restart DSS:



```
./bin/dss restart

```


You should now be able to read all Shapefiles.
