Server filesystem[¶](#server-filesystem "Permalink to this heading")
====================================================================


You can create datasets based on files located on the DSS server itself.



Filesystem connection[¶](#filesystem-connection "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Filesystem datasets are based on a Filesystem connection, which includes a “root path” for this connection. All datasets created in this connection are located within this root path.


Filesystem connections can only be created and managed by DSS administrators.
