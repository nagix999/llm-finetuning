Data transfer on Dataiku Cloud[Â¶](#data-transfer-on-dataiku-cloud "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================================================


Data transfer out of Dataiku Cloud is limited to 1,000 GB per month on Dataiku Cloud (all Dataiku Cloud editions).


Data transfer is mostly caused by leveraging Dataiku Cloud managed compute (DSS engine or containers for Spark jobs or ML model training) on data located on a different cloud provider or region than your Dataiku instance.


Note that this 1,000 GB limit can be lifted upon motivated customer request.
