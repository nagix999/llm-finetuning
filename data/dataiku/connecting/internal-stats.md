==============================================================================


An internal stats dataset gives you access to raw data for monitoring a Dataiku DSS instance.


* **Type.** The dataset contains the following information.


	+ **Cluster tasks.** Shows the log of all the DSS\-orchestrated tasks executed through connections.
	+ **Commits (internal Git).** Shows the history of commits made by the DSS backend to the internal Git repository.
	+ **Jobs.** Shows the log of all the jobs executed.
	+ **Scenario runs.** Shows the log of all scenario runs.
	+ **Object states.** For each object, shows the history of its status.
