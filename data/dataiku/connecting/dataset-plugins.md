Dataset plugins[¶](#dataset-plugins "Permalink to this heading")
================================================================


[DSS plugins](../plugins/index.html) can provide new kinds of datasets. When you install a DSS plugin which contains a new dataset kind, it automatically appears in the “New dataset” menus or pages.


You can browse existing plugins from Administration \> Plugins, or from <https://www.dataiku.com/dss/plugins>.


You can also write your own plugin in Python to connect to a new kind of data source. See [Plugins](../plugins/index.html) for more information about writing DSS plugins.
