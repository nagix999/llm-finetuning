FTP[¶](#ftp "Permalink to this heading")
========================================


Data Science Studio can use FTP servers to:


* Read and write datasets
* Read and write managed folders



Note


You can use the DSS [Download recipe](../other_recipes/download.html) to cache the contents from a FTP server.


This can provide better performance if you need to read FTP files a lot of time,
and don’t mind the copy of the data which is made into a DSS managed folder.


By default, the download recipe will still check the FTP server for updates when its
output folder is rebuilt. This behavior can be disabled.




Creating a FTP connection[¶](#creating-a-ftp-connection "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Note


Creating FTP connections can only be done by DSS administrators (except if you use “personal connections”)



Interactive with a FTP server first requires the definition of a connection to the remote server, as follows:


* Go to Administration \> Connections
* Click the “New connection” button and select FTP
* Enter a name for the new connection, and the required connection parameters
* Save the new connection



### FTP connection parameters[¶](#ftp-connection-parameters "Permalink to this heading")




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Host | Host name or IP address of the FTP server to access (Mandatory) |
| User | FTP username to use, or empty for an anonymous FTP connection |
| Password | FTP password to use, or empty for an anonymous FTP connection |
| Use passive mode | Check to use FTP “passive” data transfer mode (default). Using FTP passive mode is often mandatory when there is a firewall between the Data Science Studio server and the FTP server. |
| Path | Path to the remote folder to use once connected to the FTP server. Start with a `/` to specify an absolute path, without `/` the path will be relative to the startup directory. |
| Writable | Check to allow DSS to write datasets on this server. Those datasets will be written in a subfolder or the `path` (or the startup directory if `path` is empty) bearing the name of the dataset. |
| Allow managed datasets | Check to allow DSS to write [managed datasets](../concepts/index.html#managed-datasets) on this server. Requires `Writable`. |
| Allow managed folders | Check to allow DSS to write managed folders on this server. Requires `Writable`. |
| Use global proxy | When checked, use the [global proxy](../operations/proxies.html#proxy) for this connection. Uncheck this if the FTP server is directly accessible. If you have an HTTP proxy, passive mode is mandatory. |





Creating FTP datasets[¶](#creating-ftp-datasets "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


After setting up a FTP connection, simply add a new
dataset to your project, choosing the “FTP” type. Select your FTP
connection.


If necessary, specify a path (subpath of the connection’s path if it is not
empty) or click “Browse” and select a file or directory.


If the final path a directory, the data is the union of all the data in all the
files in that directory (including sub\-directories). The preview displayed in the dataset creation screen will
only present data from the first non\-empty file.




Use the FTP dataset for writing[¶](#use-the-ftp-dataset-for-writing "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Two cases are supported:


1. In a folder:
	* the data will be written in possibly multiple files
	* the content of the folder is wiped before writing
	* writing a [managed dataset](../concepts/index.html#managed-datasets) requires a directory
2. In a file:
	* you must create the file beforehand (it may be empty)
	* the file is emptied before writing
