Public REST API[Â¶](#public-rest-api "Permalink to this heading")
================================================================


The Dataiku Govern public API allows you to interact with Govern from any external system. It allows you to perform a large variety of administration and maintenance operations, in addition to access to items and other data managed by Dataiku Govern.


The Dataiku Govern public API is available:



> * As a [Python API client](https://developer.dataiku.com/latest/concepts-and-examples/govern/index.html "(in Developer Guide)"). This allows you to easily send commands to the public API from a Python program. This is the recommended way to interact with the API.
> * As an [HTTP REST API](rest.html). This lets you interact with Dataiku Govern from any program that can send an HTTP request. This requires more work.


Example usage of the Python client can be found [in the Developer Guide](https://developer.dataiku.com/latest/concepts-and-examples/govern/govern-client.html "(in Developer Guide)").
