Workspaces[¶](#workspaces "Permalink to this heading")
======================================================


Workspaces are a streamlined access point through which stakeholders can easily find and access AI\-driven insights and tools across all projects on a DSS instance. Making it easier for analytics teams to distribute their work to external audiences is key to integrating data and AI throughout an organization.


In a workspace, you’ll see the objects that have been shared there from a variety of DSS projects like **Applications, dashboards, webapps, datasets, and wiki articles**. In addition, **external** links can also be shared into a workspace.
It can be accessed with **Workspace** application menu or from the home page. According to the DSS instance setup, you will see the list of workspaces available to you and according to your roles and privileges you will be able to:


* Manage Workspaces
* Sharing objects into Workspaces
* Collaborate with local discussions on workspaces and objects
