Sharing DSS objects into a workspace[¶](#sharing-dss-objects-into-a-workspace "Permalink to this heading")
==========================================================================================================


In order to provide proper governance over access and sharing, the ability to [share objects](../security/permissions.html) into a Dataiku Workspace is managed at the project level.


Workspaces can be accessed either through the application menu or from the home page. You’ll see the list of workspaces you belong to and, according to your roles and privileges, will be able to manage workspaces, and share objects into workspaces.


Once granted, a user can share DSS objects into a workspace either from the object’s Right Pane within the project or from the (\+) button within the workspace. The DSS object will appear in the list of workspace items once it has been successfully added.


Once an object is shared with a Dataiku Workspace, it is shared with equal visibility among all users in the workspace, regardless of role.
