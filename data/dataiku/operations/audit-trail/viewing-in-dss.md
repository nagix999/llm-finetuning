Viewing the audit trail in DSS[Â¶](#viewing-the-audit-trail-in-dss "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================================================


You can view the latest audit events directly in the DSS UI: Administration \> Security \> Audit trail.


Note that this live view only includes the last 1000 events logged by DSS, and it is reset each time DSS is restarted. You should use log files or external systems for real auditing purposes.
