The Charts Interface[¶](#the-charts-interface "Permalink to this heading")
==========================================================================


![../_images/charts.png](../_images/charts.png)
The Charts interface has the following components:


* The **Columns, Sampling \& Engine panel** is a control with two tabs.


	+ The Columns tab provides a searchable list of columns in the dataset that you can use to build charts. A special *Count of records* column is always available.
	+ The [Sampling \& Engine](sampling.html) tab allows you to set how the dataset is processed.
* The **Chart type selector** determines the form of the chart. Choose from the [Basics](charts-basics.html), [Tables](charts-tables.html), [Scatters](charts-scatters.html), [Maps](charts-maps.html), or [Other](charts-other.html) chart types.
* **Chart definition elements** define the contents of the chart. The exact set of required elements varies by chart type. Drag and drop columns from the Columns panel to the appropriate controls here.
	+ Measures and dimensions settings can be found in this area. To access them, click the carret before the measure/dimension name. From this carret you’ll be able to configure the element and access its [formatting options](formatting.html).
* The **Publish button** creates an [Insight](../dashboards/insights/index.html) from the Chart and publishes it to a [Dashboard](../dashboards/index.html)
* The **Common chart elements** refine the display of the chart. The **Setup** tab defines the data used in the chart and how the chart will be build; and the **Format** tab allows to customize and refine it. See [Common Chart Elements](common.html) for details.
* The **Chart display** displays the currently defined chart. You can edit the title of the chart by clicking on the pencil icon.
* The **Chart tabs** along the bottom of the display allow you to navigate between multiple charts created for the dataset. You can duplicate or delete individual charts, or click **\+Chart** to create a new chart from scratch.
