Tables[Â¶](#tables "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================


Tables build visualizations based on the following types of dropzone:


* Rows dropzone, whose bins define how records are broken down along rows of the table.
* Columns dropzone, whose bins define how records are broken down along columns of the table.



Note



Either a Row or a Column must be specified, but at least one is required.
You can use as many columns as you want on a dropzone


* A required Content column (and optionally more than one), whose values are aggregated for each row/column bin.

Tables include an optional option that colors the table cells based upon the aggregated values of the Color column, like a heat map.
