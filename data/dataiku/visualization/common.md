Common Chart Elements[¶](#common-chart-elements "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================


The following controls have a common purpose across all chart types, though not every feature is available for every chart type.


* By default, all rows are used to produce the chart. To focus the chart on a subset of records, drag one or more columns to the **Filters** control in the **Setup** tab and select which values of those columns should be displayed, and which should be filtered out. For more information about filter settings, see [Filter settings](filter-settings.html).
* **Color** controls in the **Format** tab define the color in the charts. See [Color palettes](palettes.html) for details.
* By default, charts are static. To animate a chart, drag a column to the **Animation** control in the **Setup** tab.
* By default, a single chart is produced. To create paneled charts, drag a column to the **Subcharts** control in the **Setup** tab.
* By default, charts include tooltips for points in the chart. Drag one or more columns to the **Tooltip** control in the **Setup** tab in order to add information on those columns to the tooltips. You can also disable the tooltips by unchecking the ‘Show tooltips’ section.
