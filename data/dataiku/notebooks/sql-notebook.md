Creating a SQL notebook[¶](#creating-a-sql-notebook "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can create a SQL notebook either from the “Notebooks” tab of your project. Select SQL and then select the SQL connection on which you want to create the notebook.




Cells and history[¶](#cells-and-history "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------


A SQL notebook is made of several *cells*. Each cell is where you execute and modify a single query and view its results. The recommended way to work with a SQL notebook is to keep a single cell for each query that you might want to rerun at a later time.


Each cell has its own history so you can work on tuning and debugging your queries with confidence, you’ll always be able to find previously executed states.
