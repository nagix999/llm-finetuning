How to Manage Large Flows with Flow Folding[¶](#how-to-manage-large-flows-with-flow-folding "Permalink to this heading")
========================================================================================================================


As the number of objects in a flow grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to visually comprehend. By selectively hiding parts of the flow, you can focus on and make sense of subsections of it.



Folding and Unfolding a Flow[¶](#folding-and-unfolding-a-flow "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To hide objects in the Flow:


* Right\-click on a dataset or recipe in the flow
* Select **Hide all upstream** or **Hide all downstream**. As you hover over each option, the links between objects that will be hidden turn from solid lines to dashed lines. *Upstream* is the direction toward the source (inputs) of the Flow, and *downstream* is the direction toward the end (outputs) of the Flow.


The hidden objects in the Flow are represented by a **\+** within a circle. You can hide multiple subsections of the Flow.


To show hidden objects in the Flow:


* Click on any **\+** sign within a circle. As you hover over one of these symbols, the subsection of Flow that will be unfolded is displayed.
