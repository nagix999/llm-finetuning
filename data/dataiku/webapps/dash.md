Dash web apps[¶](#dash-web-apps "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================



Note


Contrary to Bokeh, Dash is not installed by default in DSS. We recommend that you create and use a [code environment](../code-envs/index.html). You need to install the dash package. You can then choose that code environment in the settings of your Dash webapp.


DSS supports Dash versions 1\.x (earlier 0\.x versions may work but have not been qualified).



To create a Dash web app, go to the Webapps list (click on the Code icon on the main toolbar then click on the Webapps tab), click new web app and select “Dash” web app, then select a template to begin.


In the Python code, you can use the regular Python API without restriction.


Each time you save your Dash webapp code, the Dash server restarts and displays the updated application; You can disable auto\-restart in the settings.
