Shiny web apps[¶](#shiny-web-apps "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================


To create a Shiny web app, go to the Webapps list (click on the Code icon on the main toolbar then click on the Webapps tab), click new web app and select “Shiny” web app, then select a template to begin.


You can then fill the “UI” and “Server” parts.


In the Server code, you can use the regular DSS R API without restriction.


Each time you save your Shiny webapp code, the Shiny server restarts and displays the updated application; You can disable auto\-restart in the settings. You can also select the [code environment](../code-envs/index.html) in the settings.
