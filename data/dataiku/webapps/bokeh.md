Bokeh web apps[¶](#bokeh-web-apps "Permalink to this heading")
==============================================================



Note


In addition to webapps, you can use Bokeh for interactive visualizations in a Jupyter notebook. You can also export “static” Bokeh visualizations (where you can zoom, pan, … but no advanced interaction) directly on the dashboard.


For more information, see [Using Bokeh](../python/bokeh.html)



To create a Bokeh web app, go to the Webapps list (click on the Code icon on the main toolbar then click on the Webapps tab), click new web app and select “Bokeh” web app, then select a template to begin.


In the Python code, you can use the regular Python API without restriction.


Each time you save your Bokeh webapp code, the Bokeh server restarts and displays the updated application; You can disable auto\-restart in the settings. You can also select the code environment in the settings.
