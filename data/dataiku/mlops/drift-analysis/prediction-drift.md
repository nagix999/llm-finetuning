Prediction Drift[Â¶](#prediction-drift "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================


Prediction Drift analyses the distribution of predictions on the evaluated data. If the distribution of predictions changes significantly, this likely indicates that the underlying data has significantly changed, which could signal a concept drift.


Having ground truth / labels is not required for Prediction Drift.
