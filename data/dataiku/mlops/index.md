MLOps[Â¶](#mlops "Permalink to this heading")
============================================


Dataiku offers numerous capabilities for implementing a complete MLOps practice:


* [The Flow](../flow/index.html) offers full lineage and traceability on the design on models
* [Deploying projects to production with full CI/CD capabilities](../deployment/index.html)
* [Visual Machine Learning](../machine-learning/index.html)
* [Real\-time REST API scoring server with versioning](../apinode/index.html)
* [Exporting models to Python, Java, MLflow and PMML for scoring outside of DSS](../machine-learning/models-export.html)
* [Comparing models, models versions and behavior of models over time](model-comparisons/index.html)
* [Performing advanced drift analysis](drift-analysis/index.html)


This section focuses on the following MLOps\-specific capabilities:


* Curating features in a Feature Store
* Evaluating and comparing models and model versions
* Analyzing drift
* Importing models from external Machine Learning systems
* Tracking code experiments
* Monitoring projects, endpoints and models health
