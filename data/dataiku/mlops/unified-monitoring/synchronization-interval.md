Synchronization interval[Â¶](#synchronization-interval "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================================


Unified Monitoring orchestrates a set of scheduled tasks to gather data from
monitored infrastructures and monitoring scopes at fixed interval.


This interval is set to 5 minutes (subject to change).


As a result, it may take some time for any change in status to be reflected
on the Unified Monitoring dashboards.
