go to the Deployer (either local or remote depending on your instance
configuration) \> Monitoring.



Overview[¶](#overview "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------


This page allows you to quickly see what needs your attention.


It displays a summary consisting of 3 panels:


* The “Overview” panel displays a categorized count of what Unified Monitoring has detected.
* The “Dataiku Projects” panel lists unhealthy deployed projects.
* The “API Endpoints” panel lists unhealthy endpoints, either DSS\-managed or external (on supported cloud platform).


If your endpoints and projects are all healthy, the “Dataiku Projects” and “API endpoints” panel will simply show a count of all elements.


If you see an unhealthy project or endpoint listed, you can click on it to see details about this project’s or endpoint’s health.


You can also click on “Dataiku Projects” or “API Endpoints” to go to the dedicated projects and endpoints screens, respectively.
