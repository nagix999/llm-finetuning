Unified Monitoring Settings[¶](#unified-monitoring-settings "Permalink to this heading")
========================================================================================



Note


This screen is only available to administrators



The *Settings* screen allows you to include or exclude project and endpoint
infrastructures from monitoring.


When setting the slider to “off”, all monitoring on this infrastructure will
stop and activity data will be erased. If you re\-activate it in the future,
monitoring will start again from scratch.


Additionally, you can configure “Monitoring Scopes” if you would like to
monitor External Endpoints from third\-party cloud providers.


To monitor External Endpoints, simply click on “New scope” and fill\-in the required information for your cloud provider.


You may click on the “Test monitoring scope” button before creation, to get a
list of accessible endpoints. Please note that additional permissions to access
their activity metrics may be required.
