Using Matplotlib[¶](#using-matplotlib "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================


Matplotlib is a Python plotting library which produces a large variety of visuals. There are several ways you can use Matplotlib in DSS:


* To display charts within a Jupyter notebook
* To display charts on a Dashboard


Documentation for Matplotlib is available at <https://matplotlib.org/>



Installing Matplotlib[¶](#installing-matplotlib "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


* If you are using the DSS built\-in environment, Matplotlib is already installed. You don’t need to do any specific installation
* If you are using a [code environment](../code-envs/index.html), you need to install the matplotlib package




Displaying charts in a Jupyter notebook[¶](#displaying-charts-in-a-jupyter-notebook "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To display Matplotlib charts in a Jupyter notebook, the easiest is to simply execute the first cell of the notebook:



```
%pylab inline

```


This automatically imports the `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot as plt` packages. It also imports `numpy as np`.


You can then use the regular Matplotlib functions.


For example, to reproduce the simplest sample “sin” figure, use:



```
# Data for plotting
t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)

plt.plot(t, s)

```


The chart displays inline in the Jupyter notebook




Displaying Matplotlib charts on a dashboard[¶](#displaying-matplotlib-charts-on-a-dashboard "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Matplotlib charts generated using Python code can be shared on a DSS dashboard using the “static insights” system. \-


Each Matplotlib figure can become a single insight in the dashboard.


To do so, create [static insights](https://developer.dataiku.com/latest/api-reference/python/static-insights.html "(in Developer Guide)")



```
from dataiku import insights

# This form saves the last displayed figure
insights.save_figure("my-matplotlib-plot")

# If f is a matplotlib figure object, you can save explicitly this figure
# rather than the last displayed one

insights.save_figure("my-matplotlib-explicit-plot", f)

```


From the Dashboard, you can then add a new “Static” insight, select the `my-matplotlib-plot` insight



### Refreshing charts on a dashboard[¶](#refreshing-charts-on-a-dashboard "Permalink to this heading")


You can refresh the charts automatically on a dashboard by using a scenario to re\-run the above piece of code.


This call to `dataiku.insights` code can be:


* In a DSS recipe (use a regular “Build” scenario step)
* In a Jupyter notebook (use a “Export notebook” scenario step)
* As a custom Python scenario step





Using matplotlib in a recipe[¶](#using-matplotlib-in-a-recipe "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Matplotlib is based on a concept of backends. Each backend knows how to display figures. When running Python on your local machine, Matplotlib will by default pop a graphical window (a Windows, macOS or Linux window) to show each plot. This is done using a specific backend for each OS.


In a notebook, when using ``%pylab inline``, it automatically activates a specific backend that displays the plots inline within the Jupyter interface.


In a recipe or in a custom Python scenario step, the notebook backend is not available. You must thus, as the very first action in your recipe, use the following code:



```
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use("Agg")

```


This forces the use of the “Agg” backend which performs rendering of the charts in\-memory. Charts can then be exported to PNG, …



Warning


This `matplotlib.use("Agg")` must take place before `import matplotlib.pyplot`. Failure to do so will generally result in an error with “Tkinter”. This error is caused by the fact that Matplotlib will by default try to import a backend called “TCL/TK” which is based on the “Tkinter” Python library, which is not usually installed
