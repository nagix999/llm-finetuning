Using Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)[Â¶](#using-microsoft-azure-kubernetes-service-aks "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================================================================


You can use containerized execution on AKS as a fully managed Kubernetes solution.


For a complete Elastic AI setup in Azure including elastic storage and elastic compute based on Kubernetes, we recommend that you read our [dedicated Azure documentation](../../cloud/azure/index.html)
