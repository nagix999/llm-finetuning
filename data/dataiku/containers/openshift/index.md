Using Openshift[¶](#using-openshift "Permalink to this heading")
================================================================



Warning


**Tier 2 support**: Openshift support is experimental and covered by [Tier 2 support](../../troubleshooting/support-tiers.html)



You can use containerized execution using Openshift 4 as the underlying Kubernetes engine.


Dataiku leverages Kubernetes as a pure base Kubernetes cluster and does not make usage of any Openshift\-specific features. Dataiku does not manage Openshift clusters. Only “unmanaged” operation is possible.
